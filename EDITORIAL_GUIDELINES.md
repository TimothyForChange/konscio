# Editorial Guidelines for Dispatches

## Purpose & Voice

Dispatches are original, analytical essays focused on eco-socialist, decolonial, and anti-imperialist perspectives from Africa and the Global South. The tone is critical, accessible, and rooted in solidarity with movements for justice and liberation.

## Structure

- **Frontmatter**: Every article must include:
  - `title`
  - `author`
  - `datePublished` (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `description`
  - `excerpt`
  - `image` (use `/images/filename.jpg`)
  - `categories` (array)
  - `tags` (array)
- **Headings**: Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) with a clear hierarchy.
- **Section Dividers**: Use `---` to separate major sections.

## Formatting

- **Lists**:
  - Start each item with a capital letter.
  - Use consistent punctuation (no trailing periods unless full sentences).
- **Blockquotes**: Use `>` for quotations, with italics for emphasis if appropriate.
- **Bold**: Use for the first mention of “The Red Soil” and for key actors, institutions, or standalone statements.
- **Italics**: Use for emphasis, calls to action, or important concepts.
- **Spacing**: Leave blank lines between sections and after frontmatter.

## Language & Style

- **Spelling**: Use UK English (e.g., “organised”, “labour”).
- **Tone**: Analytical, critical, and accessible. Avoid jargon; explain key terms.
- **Attribution**: Attribute all quotes and data. Use blockquotes for direct citations.
- **Perspective**: Write from a position of solidarity with the oppressed and exploited, centring the Global South.

## Content Focus

- Analyse the intersections of capitalism, colonialism, and ecological crisis.
- Expose structures of violence, extraction, and imperialism.
- Highlight resistance, solidarity, and alternatives rooted in justice and democracy.
- Prioritise original analysis and reporting; avoid repetition and duplication.

## Consistency Guidelines

- Ensure all frontmatter fields are present and correct.
- Use headings and section dividers properly.
- Capitalise and punctuate lists consistently.
- Standardise blockquotes and emphasis (bold/italics).
- Maintain UK English spelling throughout.
- Avoid duplicated or malformed content.
- Reference images correctly.
