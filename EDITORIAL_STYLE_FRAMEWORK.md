# ✊ Editorial & Style Framework

## For the Series and Platform: **Timothy for Change**

_A decolonial, eco-socialist framework for writing and publishing analytical, moral, and political essays._

---

## 1. Editorial Philosophy

### Mission

To expose the structural violence of capitalism, colonialism, and ecological collapse — and to articulate credible, radical alternatives rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

### Core Belief

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are not separate crises; they are one system of domination expressed through different forms.

### Political Orientation

- **Eco-socialist:** The economy must serve life, not profit.
- **Anti-imperialist and decolonial:** Centring the Global South and its struggles.
- **Materialist and moral:** Analyse structure with an ethical compass — moral clarity is a form of precision.
- **Internationalist:** Solidarity beyond borders, race, and nation.

---

## 2. Voice and Tone

### Voice

- Authoritative but human; morally grounded, not academic.
- Declarative, lucid, rhythmic — each paragraph should read like it could be spoken at a rally or read in a seminar.

### Tone

- Serious, unsentimental, anti-euphemistic.
- Avoid the NGO or “policy analyst” register.
- Never “both-sides” imperial violence.

### Perspective

- Always from the underside of power: the oppressed, the exploited, the resisting.
- Speak with solidarity, not sympathy.

### Reader

- Globally literate and politically aware.
- Write to sharpen their analysis, not comfort them.

### Emotional Register

- Controlled anger, disciplined compassion.
- No despair, no voyeurism — clarity as defiance.

### Language

- Prefer strong verbs and short sentences.
- Use plain syntax for facts, and cadence for moral synthesis.
- Replace euphemisms (“development”, “stability”, “security”) with structural terms (“extraction”, “control”, “hegemony”).

### Prohibited Tones

- Centrist “balance”
- Technocratic distance
- Academic detachment
- Managerial humanism

### Spelling

- Use **British or South African English** consistently.

---

## 3. Structural Conventions

### Headings

- **H1 (`#`):** Essay title in **Title Case** (e.g. `# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan’s War`).
- **H2 (`##`):** Section titles in **Title Case** — each represents a distinct analytical move.
- **H3 (`###`):** Optional subsections, also in **Title Case**.

### Section Pattern

1. **Opening Frame:** Establish moral-political context and thesis.
2. **Historical Continuity:** Trace colonial roots and imperial logics.
3. **Mechanisms of Power:** Explain how structures reproduce domination.
4. **Human and Ecological Impact:** Make systems visceral.
5. **Resistance and Alternatives:** Centre agency and collective power.
6. **Conclusion:** Synthesis — moral, political, ecological. End in solidarity.

### Formatting

- **Bold:** Political emphasis, conceptual clarity, or moral statements.
- _Italics:_ Citations, foreign terms, moral stress, or introspective clauses.
- **Blockquotes:** 1–3 lines max; always attributed and contextually linked. No formatting required — handled automatically.
- **Em dashes:** Use sparingly for cadence or moral gravity — not as generic punctuation.
- Prefer colons and commas where rhythm allows.
- No numeric citations in published essays; integrate sources naturally (“According to UN data…”).

---

## 4. Excerpts & Metadata

- Every post begins with **YAML front matter** (title, author, date, description, excerpt, image, tags).
- `description` = the political stakes.
- `excerpt` = distilled moral thesis.
- Tags limited to 4–6, drawn from the global analytical framework: _Eco-socialism_, _Imperialism_, _Climate Justice_, _Global South_, _Decolonisation_, etc.
- Always title in **Title Case**; description and excerpt in **sentence case** for readability in feeds.

---

## 5. Stylistic Grammar

- **Tense:** Present for analysis; past for history; future for calls to action.
- **Voice:** Active wherever possible (“banks fund war”, not “wars are funded by banks”).
- **Pronouns:** “We” only when speaking of shared humanity or solidarity; otherwise, specify agents of power.
- **Numbers:** Use **bold numerals** for visual clarity in longform text.
- **Quotes:** Contextualise every quote — who said it, when, and why it matters.
- **Acronyms:** Define on first mention, then use freely.
- **Oxford comma:** Always.
- **Semicolons:** Use to connect linked independent clauses, not as stylistic fillers.
- **Paragraph breaks:** Frequent; never allow analysis to suffocate pace.

---

## 6. Ethical Framework

- **Agency:** Focus on those resisting, not just those suffering.
- **Specificity:** Always name systems and perpetrators.
- **Respect:** Describe without sensationalism or pity.
- **Verification:** Triangulate facts with at least two credible, independent sources.
- **Context:** Every number, quote, or fact must be anchored in meaning.
- **No objectification:** People are subjects of history, not case studies.

---

## 7. Aesthetic & Layout Principles

- **Length:** 900–1 600 words (sweet spot: 1 300).
- **Visual rhythm:** Alternate dense analysis with short declarative paragraphs.
- **Line balance:** Avoid large uninterrupted blocks; break for impact.
- **Closing:** Always ends with a statement of solidarity or a moral imperative.
- **Header images:** Optional; text must stand alone.
- **Typography:** Avoid italics for entire paragraphs; vary texture through sentence rhythm instead.

---

## 8. Series-Level Consistency

- **Opening:** YAML front matter → H1 title → epigraph (optional).
- **Subtitle:** Always analytical, never clickbait.
- **Sign-off:** “— In solidarity with…”
- **Series rhythm:** Diagnosis → Structure → Resistance → Reconstruction.
- **Epigraphs:** Use sparingly, but with purpose; prefer anti-colonial and liberationist voices (Fanon, Rodney, Sankara, Césaire, Cáceres, etc.).

## 9. Lexicon of Preferred Terms

| Preferred                | Avoid                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Global South             | Developing world      |
| Extractivism             | Resource exploitation |
| Imperial core            | Western powers        |
| Eco-socialist transition | Green growth          |
| Decolonisation           | Development aid       |
| Structural violence      | Conflict or chaos     |
| Solidarity               | Charity               |
| Reparations              | Assistance            |
| Dispossession            | Loss                  |
| Liberation               | Reform                |
| Climate justice          | Environmental policy  |
| Resistance               | Activism              |
| Empire                   | The West              |
| People and planet        | Humanity and nature   |

_Always choose words that reveal power, not obscure it._

---

## 10. Attribution and Integrity

- Attribute by name and organisation (“Amnesty International’s 2025 report found…”).
- Avoid citation clutter; weave information into narrative.
- Always name Global South researchers and activists equally alongside Western sources.
- Avoid passive “it is said” phrasing — show who says it and why.
- Never quote without verifying authenticity or context.

---

## 11. Cadence, Flow, and Emphasis

- Each paragraph = one idea or one moral turn.
- Use short declarative sentences after long analytical ones for impact.
- End sections with synthesis, not summary.
- Use repetition only as rhetorical reinforcement (“This is not… It is…”).
- Commas over dashes for pacing; dashes only when emotional weight or interruption demands it.
- Read aloud before publication — the essay must _sound_ like conviction.

---

## 12. Ethics of Representation

- Never anonymise the powerful; protect the vulnerable.
- Avoid academic distancing: say “miners”, not “human subjects”.
- Name Indigenous, African, and local knowledge as _expertise_, not anecdote.
- Avoid “voiceless” framing; people resist in myriad ways — show that.
- Imagery: dignified, relevant, non-exploitative.
- If including distressing material, anchor it in systemic analysis, not spectacle.

---

## 13. Source Policy

- **Preferred:** UN agencies, investigative NGOs, local movements, peer-reviewed work, and credible journalists from the Global South.
- **Avoid:** Unverified secondary blogs, partisan propaganda, and single-sourced claims.
- **Verification:** Always cross-check at least two independent sources.
- **Transparency:** Admit uncertainty when data are contested.
- **Archival:** Preserve source copies to prevent link rot.

---

## 14. Example Editorial Blueprint

**Headline:** _Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan’s War_
**Thesis:** Gold finances war and empire through extractive and geopolitical complicity.

**Sectional Flow:**

1. Opening moral thesis
2. Historical and structural context
3. Material mechanisms (gold, routes, arms)
4. Human and ecological cost
5. Systemic complicity
6. Comparative parallels (Congo, Palestine)
7. Programme for justice
8. Closing solidarity appeal

---

## 15. Editorial Values Summary

> “To write is to resist forgetting.
> To analyse is to fight despair with understanding.”

Every piece should:

- Name systems of domination.
- Expose the machinery of empire — economic, legal, ecological.
- Honour the agency of resistance.
- End with moral and political clarity.

This is not reporting.
This is **eco-socialist analysis in service of liberation.**

---

## 16. Maintenance and Evolution

- Update this document quarterly as the project matures.
- Revisit punctuation and tone conventions to maintain stylistic cohesion.
- Archive old versions for transparency and accountability.
