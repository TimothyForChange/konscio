# ✊ Editorial & Style Framework

## For the Series and Platform: **Timothy for Change**

_A decolonial, eco-socialist framework for writing and publishing analytical, moral, and political essays._

---

## 1. Editorial Philosophy

### Mission

To expose the structural violence of capitalism, colonialism, and ecological collapse — and to articulate credible, radical alternatives rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

### Core Belief

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are not separate crises but one system of domination expressed through different forms.

### Political Orientation

- **Eco-socialist** – the economy must serve life, not profit.
- **Anti-imperialist and decolonial** – centring the Global South and its struggles.
- **Materialist and moral** – analyse structure, but always with an ethical compass.
- **Internationalist** – solidarity over borders, race, and nation.

## 2. Voice and Tone

| Attribute              | Guideline                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice**              | Authoritative, morally grounded, uncompromising. Combines clarity with moral urgency.                                                                          |
| **Tone**               | Serious, declarative, anti-euphemistic. Avoid false neutrality, sentimentality, or technocratic jargon.                                                        |
| **Perspective**        | Rooted in solidarity and structural critique, not voyeurism or pity.                                                                                           |
| **Reader**             | Politically aware, globally literate, seeking depth and direction. Treat them as adults capable of radical thought.                                            |
| **Emotional register** | Controlled anger and moral clarity; empathy without romanticisation.                                                                                           |
| **Language**           | Prefer strong verbs and plain syntax. Replace euphemisms (“development”, “security”, “stability”) with structural terms (“extraction”, “control”, “hegemony”). |
| **Prohibited tones**   | Centrist “balance”, NGO managerialism, passive-voice evasion.                                                                                                  |
| **Spelling**           | Prefer British English or South African English spelling in all articles.                                                                                      |

## 3. Structural Conventions

### Headings

- H1: Essay title (as in `# The Congo Basin: Africa’s Lungs Under Siege`)
- H2 (`##`): Section titles, each representing a distinct analytical move (context → structure → resistance → alternative).
- H3 (`###`): Optional for subsections (e.g., “Human Cost”, “Policy Demands”).

### Section Pattern

1. **Opening Frame:** 1–3 paragraphs that establish the system or crisis in moral-political terms.
2. **Historical Context:** Link to colonial and imperial continuity.
3. **Mechanisms of Power:** Detail how the structure operates (economy, law, ecology).
4. **Human and Ecological Impact:** Make abstraction concrete.
5. **Resistance and Alternatives:** Centring agency of the oppressed.
6. **Conclusion:** Moral synthesis and call to solidarity.

### Formatting

- **Bold** for emphasis of key political terms or moral conclusions.
- _Italics_ for quotes, foreign phrases, or conceptual stress.
- **Blockquotes** for quotations from thinkers, activists, or reports (1–2 lines max).
- Use em dashes (`—`) for cadence and moral gravity, not excessive punctuation.
- No numbered citations in final publication. Integrate facts contextually (“According to UN data…” or “Studies estimate…”) when necessary.

### Excerpts & Metadata

- Always include `description` and `excerpt` fields that summarise political stakes, not just topic.
- `tags` and `categories` must connect to the global framework: `Decolonisation`, `Eco-socialism`, `Imperialism`, `Climate Justice`, `Human Rights`.

## 4. Stylistic Grammar

| Element          | Rule                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tense**        | Present for analysis; past for history; future for programme.                                                   |
| **Voice**        | Active wherever possible (“actors dispossess”, not “people are dispossessed”).                                  |
| **Pronouns**     | Inclusive “we” only when referring to global humanity or solidarity networks — never to obscure responsibility. |
| **Numbers**      | Use **bold numerals** for key statistics to ensure visual clarity.                                              |
| **Quotes**       | Always contextualised; attribute activists and scholars by name and role, not title alone.                      |
| **Acronyms**     | Define on first mention (e.g., “Rapid Support Forces (RSF)”).                                                   |
| **Oxford comma** | Required for precision.                                                                                         |

---

## 5. Ethical Framework

- **Centring agency:** Always prioritise the voices, labour and resistance of people directly affected.
- **No abstraction of suffering:** Link every statistic to lived experience.
- **Avoid academic citation chains:** Replace with synthesis of verified knowledge in plain language.
- **Anti-exoticism:** Describe without fetishisation or paternalism.
- **Accountability:** Expose power, name perpetrators, highlight alternatives.

---

## 6. Aesthetic & Layout Principles

- **Header images are optional**, not required. Text should stand on its own.
- **Length:** Ideal word count per essay: 1,800–2,800 words.
- **Rhythm:** Alternate dense analysis with short declarative paragraphs for emotional clarity.
- **Closing:** Every essay ends with a statement of solidarity or moral imperative (e.g., “In solidarity with…”, “The struggle continues…”).

## 7. Series-Level Consistency

| Component            | Instruction                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Opening format**   | YAML front matter (title, author, date, description, excerpt, image [optional], tags).           |
| **Subtitle**         | Always explanatory, never clickbait.                                                             |
| **Byline**           | “Timothy Brits” — maintain single consistent author signature.                                   |
| **Sign-off**         | End with a solidarity phrase (e.g., “— In solidarity with…”).                                    |
| **Series hierarchy** | Thematic arcs should move from **diagnosis** → **mechanisms** → **resistance and alternatives**. |

## 8. Lexicon of Preferred Terms

| Preferred                | Avoid                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Global South             | Developing world      |
| Extractivism             | Resource exploitation |
| Imperial core            | Western powers        |
| Eco-socialist transition | Green growth          |
| Decolonisation           | Development aid       |
| Structural violence      | Conflict or chaos     |
| Solidarity               | Charity               |
| Reparations              | Assistance            |
| Dispossession            | Loss                  |
| Liberation               | Reform                |

---

## 9. Attribution and Integrity

- When referencing data, use natural attribution (“UN experts estimate…”, “Research by Congolese activists shows…”).
- For activist or intellectual citations, prefer **named recognition** over numeric footnotes.
- Preserve transparency without cluttering text.
- Never use AI-generated or unverifiable sources in factual claims.

---

## 10. Example Editorial Flow

1. **Headline:** _Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan’s War_
2. **Thesis:** Gold extraction underpins the RSF’s war economy and the UAE’s complicity.
3. **Structure:**
   - Context of war and extraction
   - Actors and beneficiaries
   - Ecological and human cost
   - Policy and solidarity responses
   - Closing appeal

This pattern should repeat across all essays with thematic variation.

---

## 11. Editorial Values Summary

> “To write is to resist forgetting.
> To analyse is to fight despair with understanding.”

Every piece should:

- Name systems of domination.
- Expose economic, legal, and ecological machinery of power.
- Honour the agency of those who resist.
- End with a call to justice — not sentimentality.

This is not reporting.
This is **eco-socialist analysis in service of liberation**.

---

## 12. Citation and Source Policy

- **Preferred sources:** UN agencies, reputable NGOs, peer-reviewed journals, investigative journalism, and primary documents (treaties, resolutions, budget reports).
- **Avoid:** Anonymous blogs, partisan propaganda, unverifiable statistics, or secondary summaries without primary verification.
- **Attribution method:** Integrate citations within sentences (“UN experts report…”, “According to research by Amnesty International…”).
- **Verification:** Cross-check factual claims against at least two independent credible sources.
- **Archiving:** Save or snapshot cited web materials to prevent link rot.
- **Transparency:** Mention uncertainties directly if figures or claims are contested — clarity is more credible than false precision.

---

## 13. Ethics of Representation

- **Consent and dignity:** Never publish identifiable details about vulnerable individuals without explicit consent.
- **Positionality:** Write consciously from solidarity, not saviourism.
- **Language:** Avoid terms implying helplessness or backwardness. Use politically precise language (“dispossessed”, not “voiceless”).
- **Quoting activists:** Attribute names and organisations where safe, respecting both credit and security.
- **Imagery:** When included, ensure visuals are dignified, contextually relevant, and non-exploitative.
- **Cultural respect:** Recognise Indigenous and community knowledge as legitimate expertise — not anecdote or folklore.
