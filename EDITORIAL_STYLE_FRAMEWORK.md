# ✊ Editorial & Style Framework

## For the Series and Platform: **The Red Soil**

_A decolonial, eco-socialist framework offering adaptable guidance for analytical, moral, and political essays._

---

## 0. Purpose & Living Document

This framework clarifies shared political, ethical, and stylistic foundations while protecting creative freedom. Treat rules as guardrails, not shackles. If a choice strengthens clarity, moral force, or political precision, it is valid — even if not yet reflected below. Propose improvements via PR with a brief rationale.

### Core Non‑Negotiables

1. Name systems of power (capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, extraction) rather than obscuring them.
2. Centre Global South perspectives and resistance; avoid pity framing.
3. Maintain moral clarity: do not "both‑sides" structural or imperial violence.
4. Verification: triangulate substantive claims (stats, quotes) with at least two credible sources unless primary source is authoritative.
5. Respect and specificity: attribute, contextualise, avoid sensationalism.
6. Political sign‑off or solidarity gesture is encouraged but optional.
7. Use decolonial lexicon that reveals power (see Lexicon) unless quoting contrary language critically.

### Flexible Guidance (Adaptable)

Structure, length, blockquote length, number of tags, and rhetorical devices may flex to serve argument, rhythm, or emphasis.

---

## 1. Editorial Philosophy

### Mission

Expose structural violence (capitalism–colonialism–climate collapse as one system) and encourage credible, radical alternatives rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

### Core Belief

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are expressions of one integrated domination system.

### Political Orientation

- **Eco‑socialist:** Economy serves life, not profit.
- **Anti‑imperialist & decolonial:** Centre Global South struggles and agency.
- **Materialist & moral:** Structural analysis guided by ethical precision.
- **Internationalist:** Solidarity beyond borders, race, nation.

---

## 2. Voice and Tone

### Voice

Authoritative yet human; declarative, lucid, rhythmic. Rally speech clarity with analytical depth — not academic opacity.

### Tone

Serious, unsentimental, anti‑euphemistic. Reject NGO technocracy unless critiquing it.

### Perspective

Write from underside of power — exploited, resisting, organising. Solidarity over sympathy.

### Reader

Assume informed, globally literate reader seeking sharper analysis, not comfort.

### Emotional Register

Controlled anger + disciplined compassion. Avoid despair voyeurism; clarity as defiance.

### Language

Strong verbs, concise sentences for facts; cadence for synthesis. Replace euphemisms ("stability") with structural terms ("control").

### Avoided Tones

Centrist "balance", technocratic detachment, managerial humanism, moral flattening.

### Multilingual

Non‑English dispatches welcome; maintain political precision.

---

## 3. Structural Conventions

### Headings

- Use **Title Case** for all headings (H1–H3). Exceptions allowed in stylistic epigraphs.
- Vary heading form to prevent formula repetition.

### Suggested Analytical Moves (Choose / Rearrange / Omit)

1. Opening frame / thesis
2. Historical continuity
3. Mechanisms / structures
4. Human & ecological impact
5. Resistance & alternatives
6. Synthesis / solidarity close

Alternative patterns (chronological, comparative, problem–solution) are valid. Combine or hybridise. Add brief micro‑sections for pacing if needed.

### Formatting Guidance (Flexible)

**Bold:** Moral emphasis, conceptual clarity, key stats.
_Italics:_ Citations, foreign terms, introspective clauses, emphasised moral turns.
**Blockquotes:** Purpose over length. 1–5 lines acceptable if tightly contextualised. Epigraph at start may exceed if integral.
**Em dashes:** Use for weight or interruption; avoid clutter. Prefer commas/periods for pace.
Numeric citations avoided; weave sources in narrative ("UN data show...").

---

## 4. Excerpts & Metadata

YAML front matter required: `title`, `author`, `datePublished`, `description`, `excerpt`, `categories`, `tags`, (optional: `image`, `draft`).
`description`: stakes + context (sentence case). `excerpt`: distilled moral thesis (sentence case).
Tags: Recommend 4–8. Allow specific proper nouns ("Africa Corps", "Congo Basin") when necessary for precision. Prefer conceptual + situational mix.

---

## 5. Stylistic Grammar

**Tense:** Present for analysis; past for history; future/conditional for programmatic vision.
**Voice:** Active preferred; passive only to foreground structure or when agent unknown.
**Pronouns:** "We" reserved for collective humanity or solidarity — specify agents otherwise.
**Numbers:** Bold significant figures for scannability (**1.2 billion tonnes**). Provide meaningful context (time frame, scope).
**Quotes:** Always attribute ("— Name, Source (Year)"). Add one sentence framing relevance.
**Acronyms:** Define once, then use.
**Oxford comma:** Yes for clarity.
**Semicolons:** Legitimate for tightly linked clauses; avoid ornamental stacking.
**Paragraphs:** One idea or moral turn per paragraph; vary length for rhythm.

---

## 6. Ethical Framework

Agency over victimhood; specificity over abstraction; respect over spectacle.
Triangulate; contextualise; name perpetrators where safe. Ecological harms treated as structural violence, not collateral.
Never aestheticise suffering; link every distressing detail to systemic cause and resistance.

---

## 7. Aesthetic & Layout Principles

**Length:** Guideline 900–1,800 words (sweet spot ~1,300). Exceed freely if complexity demands; cut if repetition dilutes force.
**Rhythm:** Alternate dense analytical paragraphs with short declarative lines.
**Blocks:** Break long multi‑clause paragraphs to prevent cognitive fatigue.
**Closing:** Prefer synthesis + solidarity (imperative or moral clarity). Sign‑off ("— In solidarity with…") recommended, not mandatory.
**Images:** Optional. Text should stand alone; images augment, not substitute.
**Typography:** Avoid full‑paragraph italics; vary texture via sentence architecture.

---

## 8. Series‑Level Consistency

Opening flow: Front matter → H1 → optional epigraph (quote ≤ ~6 lines with attribution).
Subtitle lines may appear inside `description` or body; keep analytical, never clickbait.
Series rhythm evolves: Diagnosis → Structure → Resistance → Reconstruction is a model, not a rule.

---

## 9. Lexicon of Preferred Terms

| Preferred                | Avoid                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Global South             | Developing world      |
| Extractivism             | Resource exploitation |
| Imperial core            | Western powers        |
| Eco‑socialist transition | Green growth          |
| Decolonisation           | Development aid       |
| Structural violence      | Conflict / chaos      |
| Solidarity               | Charity               |
| Reparations              | Assistance            |
| Dispossession            | Loss                  |
| Liberation               | Reform                |
| Climate justice          | Environmental policy  |
| Resistance               | Activism              |
| Empire                   | The West              |
| People and planet        | Humanity and nature   |

Use alternatives strategically to reveal power; if using avoided terms, frame critically (e.g., "so‑called 'development aid'").

---

## 10. Attribution & Integrity

Name sources (individual + organisation) where possible. Attribute Global South scholarship equally. Avoid vague "it is said"; specify actors. Quote only with authenticity; verify contested claims. Incorporate source context into prose ("According to WHO 2025 data..."). Maintain source archive to mitigate link rot.

---

## 11. Cadence, Flow & Emphasis

Aim: conceptual build → moral turn → declarative reinforcement. Deploy short sentences after long analytic ones for impact. Use purposeful repetition ("This is not X; it is Y") sparingly; diversify rhetorical frames ("Rather than X, we confront Y"). Read aloud for cadence; prose should sound like conviction without grandiosity.

---

## 12. Ethics of Representation

Do not anonymise power; protect vulnerable identities where risk exists. Recognise Indigenous, African, local knowledge as expertise. Reject "voiceless" framing — centre agency and strategy. Anchor distressing details in systemic analysis and resistance pathways.

---

## 13. Source Policy

Preferred: UN agencies, investigative NGOs, local movements, peer‑reviewed research, credible Global South journalists, community documentation. Avoid: single‑source speculative claims, partisan propaganda, uncorroborated social media. Transparently note uncertainty where data conflict. Preserve offline copies when feasible.

---

## 14. Example Editorial Approaches (Non‑Exhaustive)

Approach examples are prompts, not templates:

1. Traditional Flow
2. Problem–Solution
3. Comparative Analysis
4. Chronological Investigation
5. Supply Chain Deconstruction
6. Resistance Case Study Mosaic

Combine or mutate structures to fit argument integrity.

---

## 15. Editorial Values Summary

> "To write is to resist forgetting.
> To analyse is to fight despair with understanding."

Each piece strives to:

- Reveal systems of domination.
- Expose machinery of empire (economic, legal, ecological).
- Honour resistance and collective agency.
- Deliver moral + political clarity.

This is **eco‑socialist analysis in service of liberation**, not neutral commentary.

---

## 16. Maintenance, Evolution & Versioning

Review quarterly or after major stylistic innovation. Use semantic versioning for substantial changes (e.g., 2.1 for minor wording updates, 3.0 for structural overhaul). Keep changelog at end. Archive previous versions in repo history.

---

## 17. Citation & Reference Style

Clear sourcing strengthens political credibility without clogging prose. Use citations deliberately.

### 17.1 When to Cite (Must vs Optional)

**Cite (footnote or inline) when a sentence contains:**

1. Quantitative data (numbers, dates, volumes, casualties, monetary figures).
2. Contested / recent developments (policy shifts, organisational restructures, sanctions, violence incidents).
3. Specific attributions of abuse, ecological harm, or logistics (named mine, route, company, perpetrator).
4. Specialised analytical framing drawn from an external investigation (e.g. supply chain mechanism, finance channel) not common knowledge.
5. Quotations (always) – attribute with source + year in the blockquote attribution line.

**Optional citation** for: widely known historical events, broad comparative claims already grounded earlier, general moral assertions. When omitting a citation, ensure claim is genuinely common knowledge or previously supported.

### 17.2 Integration Hierarchy

Prefer integrating source names in prose first; fall back to footnotes when:

- Multiple sources underpin a single factual clause.
- Source name repetition would drag rhythm.
- You need to preserve flow in a high‑cadence paragraph.

Examples:
"Treasury sanctions detail how gold concessions underwrite mercenary payrolls." (Implicit reference if previously cited.)
"Gold laundering through Dubai’s refineries (UK Parliament report; GI-TOC) channels extraction into war finance." (Inline consolidation.)

### 17.3 Footnote Conventions

- Use Markdown `[^n]` footnotes (remark-gfm) with sequential numbering.
- No brackets `[n]`; always caret form.
- Avoid citation clusters longer than 2 footnotes in a single clause; consolidate to the strongest or most synthetic sources.
- After removing or adding sources, renumber for clarity (no gaps) unless preserving historical numbering is essential for already published external references.
- Do not cross‑link footnotes; each stands alone. If two footnotes cover distinct aspects of one sentence, split the sentence or synthesize.

### 17.4 Verification & Triangulation

- Target two independent credible sources for each substantive, non‑public‑domain factual claim (especially numbers or abuses).
- "Credible" includes: investigative NGOs, peer‑reviewed research, parliamentary / multilateral reports, recognised journalism, community organisations documenting primary evidence.
- If only one authoritative source exists (e.g. specialised satellite report), note that authority in prose.

### 17.5 Source Selection Priorities

Order of preference (all else equal):
Local / regional investigative org → International investigative NGO → Public official report → Peer-reviewed research → Reputable journalism → Aggregated databases.
Deprioritise: single‑author opinion pieces without evidence, unsourced social media threads, uncorroborated corporate PR.

### 17.6 Stylistic Rules for Citing

- Avoid numeric citations mid‑paragraph if a clean attribute is possible: "According to the 2025 UK Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee report…"
- Use bold only for moral emphasis or significant figures; do not bold source names.
- Maintain rhythm: place footnotes at natural clause ends, not mid‑phrase.
- Do not capitalise entire source titles; follow original case.

### 17.7 Quotes

Format blockquote attribution as: `> — Name, Source (Year)`.
If paraphrasing rather than direct quoting: integrate into prose and cite per 17.3.

### 17.8 Reducing Citation Load

To declutter:

- Merge repetitive sentences that each cite the same source.
- Reference a source once early; subsequent sentences can rely on established context if clearly connected.
- Replace multiple adjacent footnotes with a synthesised attribution phrase.

### 17.9 Updating / Retractions

- If a cited source is later discredited or corrected, update the footnote with an appended note: "(Updated: previous figure replaced after revised audit, Month Year)."
- Preserve original claim only if historically relevant; otherwise remove and renumber.

### 17.10 Link Rot Protection

- For high‑risk or transient pages (investigative NGO press releases), archive locally (download PDF or store key excerpts) and optionally include the archived URL in parentheses.
- Prefer stable resource URLs (report landing pages) over ephemeral news article variants.

### 17.11 Ethical Considerations

- Avoid over‑citation that buries Global South voices beneath Global North institutional reports.
- Balance sources: if using a Northern parliamentary report for a pattern, pair with local testimony or regional investigative work.
- Do not cite exploitative or propagandistic sources without critical framing; if essential, label clearly ("state media claim" / "corporate disclosure").

### 17.12 Practical Workflow for New Pieces

1. Draft argument skeleton without footnotes.
2. Mark every sentence needing verification with `[[SOURCE?]]` placeholder.
3. Collect sources; prefer at least two per placeholder.
4. Integrate strongest source into prose; footnote remaining if still needed.
5. Run a pass to consolidate clusters and ensure numbering continuity.
6. Final proof: each footnote referenced exactly once; no orphan definitions.

### 17.13 Minimal Citation Set Guidance

Aim for a lean, high‑integrity core: roughly 8–14 footnotes for a 1,200–1,500 word dispatch, weighted toward structural mechanisms, abuse evidence, and quantitative material rather than generic geopolitical facts.

### 17.14 Examples (Abstracted)

"Mercenary contracts swap palace security for mining concessions."[^a] (Single authoritative policy analysis.)
"Satellite imagery shows tree cover loss accelerating around the concession perimeter."[^b][^c] (Two independent remote sensing sources.)

(`[^a]`, `[^b]`, `[^c]` used in examples only; not part of live numbering.)
