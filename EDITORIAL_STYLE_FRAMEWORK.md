# ✊ Editorial & Style Framework

## For the Series and Platform: **Timothy for Change**

_A decolonial, eco-socialist framework offering guidelines and suggestions for writing and publishing analytical, moral, and political essays._

---

## 1. Editorial Philosophy

### Mission

To help expose the structural violence of capitalism, colonialism, and ecological collapse — and to encourage credible, radical alternatives rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

### Core Belief

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are not separate crises; they are one system of domination expressed through different forms.

### Political Orientation

- **Eco-socialist:** The economy should serve life, not profit.
- **Anti-imperialist and decolonial:** Centre the Global South and its struggles.
- **Materialist and moral:** Analyse structure with an ethical compass — moral clarity is a form of precision.
- **Internationalist:** Solidarity beyond borders, race, and nation.

## 2. Voice and Tone

### Voice

Aim for an authoritative but human voice; morally grounded, not academic. Strive for declarative, lucid, rhythmic writing — paragraphs that could be spoken at a rally or read in a seminar.

### Tone

Be serious, unsentimental, and anti-euphemistic. Avoid the NGO or "policy analyst" register. Do not "both-sides" imperial violence.

### Perspective

Write from the underside of power: the oppressed, the exploited, the resisting. Speak with solidarity, not sympathy.

### Reader

Assume a globally literate and politically aware reader. Write to sharpen their analysis, not comfort them.

### Emotional Register

Favour controlled anger and disciplined compassion. Avoid despair and voyeurism — clarity as defiance.

### Language

Prefer strong verbs and short sentences. Use plain syntax for facts, and cadence for moral synthesis. Replace euphemisms ("development", "stability", "security") with structural terms ("extraction", "control", "hegemony").

### Prohibited Tones

Avoid centrist "balance", technocratic distance, academic detachment, and managerial humanism.

### Spelling

Use clear, accessible English. Blog posts in other languages are also encouraged.

---

## 3. Structural Conventions

### Headings

- **H1 (`#`):** Essay title in **Title Case** (e.g. `# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan's War`).
- **H2 (`##`):** Section titles in **Title Case** — each represents a distinct analytical move. Vary heading language and structure to avoid repetitive patterns across articles. Consider using more creative and contextually relevant titles rather than formulaic labels.
- **H3 (`###`):** Optional subsections, also in **Title Case**.

### Section Pattern

Structure should be flexible and serve the argument, not constrain it. The following analytical moves are suggestions; their order and presentation can vary:

1. **Opening Frame:** Establish moral-political context and thesis.
2. **Historical Continuity:** Trace colonial roots and imperial logics.
3. **Mechanisms of Power:** Explain how structures reproduce domination.
4. **Human and Ecological Impact:** Make systems visceral.
5. **Resistance and Alternatives:** Centre agency and collective power.
6. **Conclusion:** Synthesis — moral, political, ecological. End in solidarity.

Articles should feel distinctive and purposeful rather than formulaic. Consider:

Try varying the sequence of analytical moves based on the subject matter. Use different structural approaches (chronological, thematic, comparative, problem-solution). Employ varied transitions between sections. Experiment with different numbers and types of sections based on content needs.

### Formatting

**Bold:** Political emphasis, conceptual clarity, or moral statements.
_Italics:_ Citations, foreign terms, moral stress, or introspective clauses.
**Blockquotes:** 1–3 lines max; always attributed and contextually linked. No formatting required — handled automatically.
**Em dashes:** Use sparingly for cadence or moral gravity — not as generic punctuation.
Prefer colons and commas where rhythm allows.
Avoid numeric citations in published essays; integrate sources naturally ("According to UN data…").

---

## 4. Excerpts & Metadata

Begin every post with **YAML front matter** (title, author, date, description, excerpt, image, tags). Use `description` for the political stakes and `excerpt` for the distilled moral thesis. Limit tags to 4–6, drawn from the global analytical framework: _Eco-socialism_, _Imperialism_, _Climate Justice_, _Global South_, _Decolonisation_, etc. Use Title Case for titles; sentence case for description and excerpt for readability in feeds.

---

## 5. Stylistic Grammar

**Tense:** Prefer present for analysis, past for history, and future for calls to action.
**Voice:** Use active voice wherever possible ("banks fund war", not "wars are funded by banks").
**Pronouns:** Use "we" only when speaking of shared humanity or solidarity; otherwise, specify agents of power.
**Numbers:** Consider using **bold numerals** for visual clarity in longform text.
**Quotes:** Contextualise every quote — who said it, when, and why it matters.
**Acronyms:** Define on first mention, then use freely.
**Oxford comma:** Recommended.
**Semicolons:** Use to connect linked independent clauses, not as stylistic fillers.
**Paragraph breaks:** Frequent; avoid analysis suffocating pace.

---

## 6. Ethical Framework

**Agency:** Focus on those resisting, not just those suffering.
**Specificity:** Name systems and perpetrators where possible.
**Respect:** Describe without sensationalism or pity.
**Verification:** Triangulate facts with at least two credible, independent sources.
**Context:** Anchor every number, quote, or fact in meaning.
**No objectification:** Treat people as subjects of history, not case studies.

---

## 7. Aesthetic & Layout Principles

**Length:** Aim for 900–1 600 words (sweet spot: 1 300).
**Visual rhythm:** Alternate dense analysis with short declarative paragraphs.
**Line balance:** Avoid large uninterrupted blocks; break for impact.
**Closing:** End with a statement of solidarity or a moral imperative where possible.
**Header images:** Optional; text should stand alone.
**Typography:** Avoid italics for entire paragraphs; vary texture through sentence rhythm instead.

---

## 8. Series-Level Consistency

**Opening:** YAML front matter → H1 title → epigraph (optional).
**Subtitle:** Prefer analytical, never clickbait.
**Sign-off:** "— In solidarity with…"
**Series rhythm:** Diagnosis → Structure → Resistance → Reconstruction.
**Epigraphs:** Use sparingly, but with purpose; prefer anti-colonial and liberationist voices (Fanon, Rodney, Sankara, Césaire, Cáceres, etc.).

## 9. Lexicon of Preferred Terms

| Preferred                | Avoid                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Global South             | Developing world      |
| Extractivism             | Resource exploitation |
| Imperial core            | Western powers        |
| Eco-socialist transition | Green growth          |
| Decolonisation           | Development aid       |
| Structural violence      | Conflict or chaos     |
| Solidarity               | Charity               |
| Reparations              | Assistance            |
| Dispossession            | Loss                  |
| Liberation               | Reform                |
| Climate justice          | Environmental policy  |
| Resistance               | Activism              |
| Empire                   | The West              |
| People and planet        | Humanity and nature   |

Try to choose words that reveal power, not obscure it.

## 10. Attribution and Integrity

Attribute by name and organisation ("Amnesty International's 2025 report found…").
Avoid citation clutter; weave information into narrative.
Name Global South researchers and activists equally alongside Western sources where possible.
Avoid passive "it is said" phrasing — show who says it and why.
Quote only with verified authenticity or context.

---

## 11. Cadence, Flow, and Emphasis

Aim for each paragraph to contain one idea or one moral turn. Use short declarative sentences after long analytical ones for impact. End sections with synthesis, not summary. Use repetition only as rhetorical reinforcement ("This is not… It is…") — but diversify expressions to avoid overuse. Vary sentence structures to prevent cadence repetition: instead of overusing "x is not y, but z," consider alternatives like "x represents z rather than y" or "rather than x, this is fundamentally y." Prefer commas over dashes for pacing; use dashes only when emotional weight or interruption demands it. Consider reading aloud before publication — the essay should _sound_ like conviction.

---

## 12. Ethics of Representation

Avoid anonymising the powerful; protect the vulnerable. Avoid academic distancing: say "miners", not "human subjects". Name Indigenous, African, and local knowledge as _expertise_, not anecdote. Avoid "voiceless" framing; people resist in myriad ways — show that. Use imagery that is dignified, relevant, and non-exploitative. If including distressing material, anchor it in systemic analysis, not spectacle.

---

## 13. Source Policy

**Preferred:** UN agencies, investigative NGOs, local movements, peer-reviewed work, and credible journalists from the Global South.
**Avoid:** Unverified secondary blogs, partisan propaganda, and single-sourced claims.
**Verification:** Try to cross-check at least two independent sources.
**Transparency:** Admit uncertainty when data are contested.
**Archival:** Preserve source copies to prevent link rot.

---

## 14. Example Editorial Approaches

Articles should follow analytical logic rather than rigid structural formulas. Consider various approaches based on the subject:

**Approach 1: Traditional Flow**

1. Opening moral thesis
2. Historical and structural context
3. Material mechanisms
4. Human and ecological cost
5. Systemic complicity
6. Comparative parallels
7. Programme for justice
8. Closing solidarity appeal

**Approach 2: Problem-Solution Structure**

1. Present the contemporary crisis
2. Historical roots and causation
3. Mechanisms of power and reproduction
4. Impact on communities and ecology
5. Alternatives and resistance
6. Pathways to justice
7. Synthesis and solidarity

**Approach 3: Comparative Analysis**

1. Opening thesis with immediate stakes
2. Parallel case studies
3. Common systemic elements
4. Divergent impacts and responses
5. Lessons for collective action
6. Broader implications

**Approach 4: Chronological Investigation**

1. Historical foundations
2. Escalation points
3. Current dynamics
4. Resistance movements
5. Future implications
6. Call to action

The key is maintaining analytical depth and political clarity while varying structural approaches to avoid formulaic patterns. Choose the structure that best serves your argument; these are suggestions, not requirements.

## 15. Editorial Values Summary

> "To write is to resist forgetting.
> To analyse is to fight despair with understanding."

Aim for every piece to:

- Name systems of domination.
- Expose the machinery of empire — economic, legal, ecological.
- Honour the agency of resistance.
- End with moral and political clarity.

This is not reporting.
This is **eco-socialist analysis in service of liberation.**
