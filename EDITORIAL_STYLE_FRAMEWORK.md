# ✊ Editorial & Style Framework

## For the Series and Platform: **The Red Soil**

_A decolonial, eco-socialist framework offering adaptable guidance for analytical, moral, and political essays._

---

## 0. Purpose & Living Document

This framework clarifies shared political, ethical, and stylistic foundations while protecting creative freedom. Treat rules as guardrails, not shackles. If a choice strengthens clarity, moral force, or political precision, it is valid — even if not yet reflected below. Propose improvements via PR with a brief rationale.

### Core Non‑Negotiables

1. Name systems of power (capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, extraction) rather than obscuring them.
2. Centre Global South perspectives and resistance; avoid pity framing.
3. Maintain moral clarity: do not "both‑sides" structural or imperial violence.
4. Verification: triangulate substantive claims (stats, quotes) with at least two credible sources unless primary source is authoritative.
5. Respect and specificity: attribute, contextualise, avoid sensationalism.
6. Political sign‑off or solidarity gesture is encouraged but optional.
7. Use decolonial lexicon that reveals power (see Lexicon) unless quoting contrary language critically.

### Flexible Guidance (Adaptable)

Structure, length, blockquote length, number of tags, and rhetorical devices may flex to serve argument, rhythm, or emphasis.

---

## 1. Editorial Philosophy

### Mission

Expose structural violence (capitalism–colonialism–climate collapse as one system) and encourage credible, radical alternatives rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

### Core Belief

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are expressions of one integrated domination system.

### Political Orientation

- **Eco‑socialist:** Economy serves life, not profit.
- **Anti‑imperialist & decolonial:** Centre Global South struggles and agency.
- **Materialist & moral:** Structural analysis guided by ethical precision.
- **Internationalist:** Solidarity beyond borders, race, nation.

---

## 2. Voice and Tone

### Voice

Authoritative yet human; declarative, lucid, rhythmic. Rally speech clarity with analytical depth — not academic opacity.

### Tone

Serious, unsentimental, anti‑euphemistic. Reject NGO technocracy unless critiquing it.

### Perspective

Write from underside of power — exploited, resisting, organising. Solidarity over sympathy.

### Reader

Assume informed, globally literate reader seeking sharper analysis, not comfort.

### Emotional Register

Controlled anger + disciplined compassion. Avoid despair voyeurism; clarity as defiance.

### Language

Strong verbs, concise sentences for facts; cadence for synthesis. Replace euphemisms ("stability") with structural terms ("control").

### Avoided Tones

Centrist "balance", technocratic detachment, managerial humanism, moral flattening.

### Multilingual

Non‑English dispatches welcome; maintain political precision.

---

## 3. Structural Conventions

### Headings

- Use **Title Case** for all headings (H1–H3). Exceptions allowed in stylistic epigraphs.
- Vary heading form to prevent formula repetition.

### Suggested Analytical Moves (Choose / Rearrange / Omit)

1. Opening frame / thesis
2. Historical continuity
3. Mechanisms / structures
4. Human & ecological impact
5. Resistance & alternatives
6. Synthesis / solidarity close

Alternative patterns (chronological, comparative, problem–solution) are valid. Combine or hybridise. Add brief micro‑sections for pacing if needed.

### Formatting Guidance (Flexible)

**Bold:** Moral emphasis, conceptual clarity, key stats.
_Italics:_ Citations, foreign terms, introspective clauses, emphasised moral turns.
**Blockquotes:** Purpose over length. 1–5 lines acceptable if tightly contextualised. Epigraph at start may exceed if integral.
**Em dashes:** Use for weight or interruption; avoid clutter. Prefer commas/periods for pace.
Numeric citations avoided; weave sources in narrative ("UN data show...").

---

## 4. Excerpts & Metadata

YAML front matter required: `title`, `author`, `datePublished`, `description`, `excerpt`, `categories`, `tags`, (optional: `image`, `draft`).
`description`: stakes + context (sentence case). `excerpt`: distilled moral thesis (sentence case).
Tags: Recommend 4–8. Allow specific proper nouns ("Africa Corps", "Congo Basin") when necessary for precision. Prefer conceptual + situational mix.

---

## 5. Stylistic Grammar

**Tense:** Present for analysis; past for history; future/conditional for programmatic vision.
**Voice:** Active preferred; passive only to foreground structure or when agent unknown.
**Pronouns:** "We" reserved for collective humanity or solidarity — specify agents otherwise.
**Numbers:** Bold significant figures for scannability (**1.2 billion tonnes**). Provide meaningful context (time frame, scope).
**Quotes:** Always attribute ("— Name, Source (Year)"). Add one sentence framing relevance.
**Acronyms:** Define once, then use.
**Oxford comma:** Yes for clarity.
**Semicolons:** Legitimate for tightly linked clauses; avoid ornamental stacking.
**Paragraphs:** One idea or moral turn per paragraph; vary length for rhythm.

---

## 6. Ethical Framework

Agency over victimhood; specificity over abstraction; respect over spectacle.
Triangulate; contextualise; name perpetrators where safe. Ecological harms treated as structural violence, not collateral.
Never aestheticise suffering; link every distressing detail to systemic cause and resistance.

---

## 7. Aesthetic & Layout Principles

**Length:** Guideline 900–1,800 words (sweet spot ~1,300). Exceed freely if complexity demands; cut if repetition dilutes force.
**Rhythm:** Alternate dense analytical paragraphs with short declarative lines.
**Blocks:** Break long multi‑clause paragraphs to prevent cognitive fatigue.
**Closing:** Prefer synthesis + solidarity (imperative or moral clarity). Sign‑off ("— In solidarity with…") recommended, not mandatory.
**Images:** Optional. Text should stand alone; images augment, not substitute.
**Typography:** Avoid full‑paragraph italics; vary texture via sentence architecture.

---

## 8. Series‑Level Consistency

Opening flow: Front matter → H1 → optional epigraph (quote ≤ ~6 lines with attribution).
Subtitle lines may appear inside `description` or body; keep analytical, never clickbait.
Series rhythm evolves: Diagnosis → Structure → Resistance → Reconstruction is a model, not a rule.

## 9. Lexicon of Preferred Terms

| Preferred                | Avoid                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Global South             | Developing world      |
| Extractivism             | Resource exploitation |
| Imperial core            | Western powers        |
| Eco‑socialist transition | Green growth          |
| Decolonisation           | Development aid       |
| Structural violence      | Conflict / chaos      |
| Solidarity               | Charity               |
| Reparations              | Assistance            |
| Dispossession            | Loss                  |
| Liberation               | Reform                |
| Climate justice          | Environmental policy  |
| Resistance               | Activism              |
| Empire                   | The West              |
| People and planet        | Humanity and nature   |

Use alternatives strategically to reveal power; if using avoided terms, frame critically (e.g., "so‑called 'development aid'").

---

## 10. Attribution & Integrity

Name sources (individual + organisation) where possible. Attribute Global South scholarship equally. Avoid vague "it is said"; specify actors. Quote only with authenticity; verify contested claims. Incorporate source context into prose ("According to WHO 2025 data..."). Maintain source archive to mitigate link rot.

---

## 11. Cadence, Flow & Emphasis

Aim: conceptual build → moral turn → declarative reinforcement. Deploy short sentences after long analytic ones for impact. Use purposeful repetition ("This is not X; it is Y") sparingly; diversify rhetorical frames ("Rather than X, we confront Y"). Read aloud for cadence; prose should sound like conviction without grandiosity.

---

## 12. Ethics of Representation

Do not anonymise power; protect vulnerable identities where risk exists. Recognise Indigenous, African, local knowledge as expertise. Reject "voiceless" framing — centre agency and strategy. Anchor distressing details in systemic analysis and resistance pathways.

---

## 13. Source Policy

Preferred: UN agencies, investigative NGOs, local movements, peer‑reviewed research, credible Global South journalists, community documentation. Avoid: single‑source speculative claims, partisan propaganda, uncorroborated social media. Transparently note uncertainty where data conflict. Preserve offline copies when feasible.

---

## 14. Example Editorial Approaches (Non‑Exhaustive)

Approach examples are prompts, not templates:

1. Traditional Flow
2. Problem–Solution
3. Comparative Analysis
4. Chronological Investigation
5. Supply Chain Deconstruction
6. Resistance Case Study Mosaic

Combine or mutate structures to fit argument integrity.

---

## 15. Editorial Values Summary

> "To write is to resist forgetting.
> To analyse is to fight despair with understanding."

Each piece strives to:

- Reveal systems of domination.
- Expose machinery of empire (economic, legal, ecological).
- Honour resistance and collective agency.
- Deliver moral + political clarity.

This is **eco‑socialist analysis in service of liberation**, not neutral commentary.

---

## 16. Maintenance, Evolution & Versioning

Review quarterly or after major stylistic innovation. Use semantic versioning for substantial changes (e.g., 2.1 for minor wording updates, 3.0 for structural overhaul). Keep changelog at end. Archive previous versions in repo history.
