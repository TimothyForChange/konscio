  "name": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a war fought over its vast mineral wealth (cobalt, coltan, gold), essential for modern electronics. The conflict involves the Congolese army, over 100 armed groups, and foreign-backed militias (notably Rwanda's M23). It has created one of the world's worst displacement crises and is characterised by the systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Belgium (King Leopold II & the Belgian State)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of Belgium's exceptionally brutal colonial rule. King Leopold II's personal Congo Free State (1885-1908) was a slave state built on a 'Red Rubber' terror system, where millions were killed or mutilated to extract rubber and ivory [Hochschild, 'King Leopold's Ghost', 1998]. The subsequent Belgian state continued this purely extractive model, intentionally building no viable local institutions and leaving behind a hollow state at independence [Young & Turner, 'The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State', 1985]. This colonial architecture of a weak state, designed for efficient extraction by outsiders, created the blueprint for the neocolonial scramble for resources that defines the DRC today."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "conflictMineralsAndProxyWars": "The DRC's mineral wealth is a curse, fuelling a neocolonial proxy war. Neighbouring states, particularly Rwanda and Uganda, have repeatedly invaded and armed militias (like the M23) to illegally extract and traffic conflict minerals [UN Group of Experts reports, 2012-2024]. Western tech and automotive companies create the demand, while these regional powers act as violent intermediaries, profiting from the chaos.",
    "theHollowState": "The 'resource curse' is a political condition rooted in the hollow state left by Belgium. Post-independence, the CIA and Belgian-backed assassination of Patrice Lumumba and the installation of the kleptocrat Mobutu Sese Seko reinforced this system [De Witte, 'The Assassination of Lumumba', 2001; US Senate Church Committee Report, 1975]. Today, the state's weakness is actively exploited by external actors who benefit from the inability to control borders or regulate mining, ensuring resources flow out while violence stays in."

    "casualties": "An estimated 6 million people have died from conflict-related causes since 1996, the deadliest conflict since World War II [International Rescue Committee, 2008; subsequent studies].",
