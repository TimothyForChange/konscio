  "name": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
  "currentCrisisSummary": "The eastern DRC is the site of an escalating conflict involving **over 130 armed groups**, foreign-backed militias, and the Congolese army. Fought primarily over control of vast *mineral wealth* (**cobalt, coltan, gold**), the war has caused one of the world's largest displacement crises and is marked by the widespread, systematic use of **sexual violence as a weapon of war**.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Belgium (King Leopold II's Congo Free State & later Belgian Congo)",
    "legacy": "The DRC's challenges have roots in its colonial history, characterised by intensive *resource extraction* of **rubber and ivory**, harsh labour conditions, and limited investment in local institutional development. The colonial administration focused primarily on resource extraction rather than building comprehensive *governance structures* or educational systems, leaving the newly independent state with significant **institutional and infrastructural gaps**."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "externalInfluences": "The conflict involves various *external actors*, including neighbouring countries and multinational corporations responding to global demand for minerals used in *clean energy technologies* and electronics. These actors often support different armed groups to secure access to mineral resources, complicating peace efforts and governance.",
    "structuralChallenges": "A key challenge is what economists call the **'resource curse'**—the paradox whereby countries rich in natural resources often struggle to translate that wealth into broad-based development. The DRC's *weak state capacity*, partly inherited from limited colonial institutional development, makes it difficult to effectively govern mineral-rich regions, leading to ongoing conflicts over **resource control**."
