    "legacy": "Ignoring Syrian calls for self-determination (e.g., the **Arab Kingdom of Syria**), France and Britain imposed the **League of Nations Mandate**, a colonial project rooted in the imperialist **Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916)**. France enforced a **'divide and rule'** strategy, fracturing Syria into sectarian statelets to weaken national identity and foster divisions that persist today. This policy, combined with exploitative economics and the establishment of a repressive **authoritarian state structure**, left a legacy of instability and vulnerability to foreign intervention."
