  "currentCrisisSummary": "A brutal civil war that began in **April 2023** between the *Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)* and the paramilitary **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)** has devastated Sudan. The conflict has triggered a severe humanitarian crisis, mass displacement, and a resurgence of *ethnically targeted violence*, particularly in **Darfur** and Khartoum.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British administration established different governance approaches across Sudan's regions, with greater investment and administrative focus in the *Arabic-speaking, Muslim North* compared to the South and peripheral regions like **Darfur**. This *uneven development pattern* created significant regional disparities in infrastructure, education, and political representation that contributed to post-independence tensions, civil wars, and ultimately the **secession of South Sudan**."

  "coreTerms": {
    "geopoliticalDimensions": "The current war represents a violent power struggle for control of Sudan's *centralised state* and its significant resources. Regional powers such as the **UAE and Egypt**, along with other international actors, have interests in Sudan's strategic *Red Sea location* and its **gold and agricultural wealth**, influencing the conflict dynamics.",
    "regionalInequalities": "The violence reflects longstanding patterns of *uneven development* and **centre-periphery tensions** that have historical roots. The conflict often pits the dominant central regions against marginalised areas like *Darfur*, continuing patterns of **political and economic inequality** that have characterised Sudan since independence."
