    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial policy was built on **divide-and-rule tactics**. It institutionalised ethnic and regional divisions by concentrating power and investment in the riverine centre while systematically underdeveloping and marginalising peripheral regions like the South and **Darfur** [Daly, 'Imperial Sudan', 1991; Sharkey, 'Living with Colonialism', 2003]. This **engineered inequality** created a parasitic central state and blocked unified resistance [Johnson, 'The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars', 2003]. By pitting communities against each other, Britain established the structural basis for the **centre-periphery conflicts** and extractive politics that have defined Sudan's post-independence history of civil war."

  "coreTerms": {
    "proxyWarForResources": "The civil war is fuelled by regional powers, particularly the **UAE**, competing for control of Sudan's resources and strategic location [CNN investigation, 2024; various UN expert reports]. Foreign backing for the warring factions transforms the internal power struggle into a proxy war for Sudan's **gold**, agricultural land, and Red Sea ports, prolonging the violence for geopolitical gain.",
    "inheritedStateViolence": "The war is an extension of the **centre-periphery violence** institutionalised during the colonial era. The state has historically used militias recruited from marginalised communities (like the RSF's precursors, the Janjaweed) to suppress dissent in other marginalised regions [De Waal, 'Famine Crimes', 1997; Flint & De Waal, 'Darfur: A New History of a Long War', 2008], a tactic that has now backfired, leading to the implosion of the central state itself."
