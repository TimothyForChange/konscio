  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since Russia's 2022 invasion, Ukraine suffers a devastating conflict, inflicting immense human suffering. Millions are displaced, cities destroyed, and tens of thousands killed.\n\nThe war is an act of brutal **Russian imperialism**, but inseparable from decades of eastward **NATO expansion**. It is a catastrophic outcome of **inter-imperialist rivalry**, turning Ukraine into a **proxy battleground**. Massive **Western arms flows** sustain the war but also deepen Ukraine's **dependency**. This **disaster capitalism** framework shapes the ongoing conflict and planned reconstruction.",

    "legacy": "Ukraine's history is marked by its position between **competing empires**. Subjected to the **Russian Empire** (colonial **Russification**) and later the **USSR** (centralised control, purges, ***Holodomor*** famine), this history informs national identity and Russia's **neo-imperial** claims.\n\nFollowing the USSR's collapse, the **US/NATO** engaged in triumphalist **eastward expansion**, treating Eastern Europe as a strategic frontier, breaking assurances, and encircling Russia. This expansion created the **structural conditions** for conflict."

      "title": "Post-Soviet Neoliberalism and Oligarchy",
      "description": "The '**shock therapy**' economic policies promoted by the **IMF** in the 1990s were imposed on Russia and Ukraine. Rapid **mass privatisation** allowed politically connected **oligarchs** to accumulate wealth. This process **hollowed out the state**, created corruption, made economies **dependent** on exports, and vulnerable to **external pressures**. The conflict is partly a struggle between these rival **oligarchic capitalist states**."

      "title": "NATO Eastward Expansion",
      "description": "The post-**Cold War expansion of NATO** was a primary driver of the crisis. Framed by the West as defensive, Russia perceived it as **aggressive encroachment**. This relentless **military expansion**, against warnings, created a **zero-sum security dilemma** shattering European peace and contributing to Russia's invasion decision."

      "title": "The 2014 Maidan Uprising and Co-optation",
      "description": "The **Maidan Uprising** was a genuine, popular, and complex revolt against the corruption of the pro-Russian Yanukovych government. However, this popular energy was **co-opted by two forces**: pro-Western **neoliberal elites** seeking integration with the EU/IMF, and **ultranationalist far-right** groups (e.g., Right Sector, Svoboda) who provided militant street power. Russia responded by illegally annexing Crimea and instigating a war in the Donbas."

      "description": "The post-2014 state-building project adopted a **hardline nationalist** position. This included the official rehabilitation of controversial WWII-era figures like **Stepan Bandera**, and the implementation of **language laws** that significantly restricted the use of Russian in public life and education. While aimed at de-Russification, these policies alienated large segments of the population in the east and south, providing a pretext for **Russian imperialist intervention**."

    {
      "title": "The Post-2014 Neoliberal Turn",
      "description": "Following Maidan, successive pro-Western governments, guided by the **IMF**, **World Bank**, and EU, implemented a second wave of deep **neoliberal reforms**. These included severe **austerity**, **privatisation**, and opening Ukraine's agricultural land market. Often conditions for **Western financial aid**, these policies deepened **economic dependency** and inequality."

Western partners plan post-war reconstruction along **neoliberal lines**, funded by loans locking Ukraine into decades of **debt** to **international financial institutions**. This prioritises **privatisation** and opportunities for **foreign corporations**. The war serves as a **geopolitical battleground** and a mechanism for restructuring Ukraine's economy for **Western capital**."
