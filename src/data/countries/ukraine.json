    "imperialPower": "Russian Empire & Soviet Union (1654-1991)",
    "legacy": "Centuries of Russian rule have been marked by attempts to suppress Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, from Tsarist Russification to the Holodomor, a Soviet-era famine that many states recognise as a genocide. This history of treating Ukraine as a subordinate territory provides the ideological basis for the current war, which many scholars argue has genocidal characteristics. The Soviet Union also left behind a centralised state economy that, upon its collapse, was captured by a new oligarchic class."

  "coreTerms": {
    "fossilFuelGeopolitics": "Russia's invasion is a war driven by its specific model of state capitalism. A ruling class of oligarchs and security officials, whose wealth derives from the control of fossil fuels, seeks to control Ukraine's industrial assets, agricultural land, and offshore energy reserves. The war is an attempt to expand this extractive economic model and eliminate a sovereign, democratic alternative on its border.",
    "nationalSovereigntyAndTheOligarchs": "The Ukrainian resistance is a dual struggle: a war for national sovereignty against Russia, and an internal fight to build a society free from its own legacy of post-Soviet oligarchic capitalism. Western support, while crucial, has been tied to economic reformsâ€”such as austerity and privatisationâ€”demanded by institutions like the IMF. The challenge is to win the war while building a sovereign economy that serves the Ukrainian people, not just foreign capital or domestic oligarchs."
