    "legacy": "Centuries of Russian imperial domination have been marked by systematic attempts to erase Ukrainian sovereignty and identity. The Russian Empire enforced cultural colonisation through Russification policies, banning the Ukrainian language (e.g., Ems Ukaz, 1876). The Soviet Union continued this imperial project through cultural suppression and political terror, culminating in the Holodomor (1932-33), a genocide by man-made famine that killed millions of Ukrainians [Timothy Snyder, 'Bloodlands', 2010]. This long history of denying Ukraine's national legitimacy and treating it as a colonial possession provides the ideological basis for the current genocidal war [New Lines Institute & Raoul Wallenberg Centre, 2022]."

  "coreTerms": {
    "imperialAmbition": "Russia's invasion is a neocolonial war of conquest intended to re-establish a sphere of influence and erase Ukraine from the map. The official denial of Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign nation is a core justification for the war, framing it not as a conflict between states but as a colonial 'reunification'.",
    "decolonisationAndResistance": "The fierce Ukrainian resistance is a continuation of a centuries-long struggle for decolonisation and self-determination. In occupied territories, Russia repeats its historical colonial playbook: imposing its language, enforcing citizenship, and systematically deporting childrenâ€”a war crime for which the ICC has issued arrest warrantsâ€”to erase Ukrainian identity and culture [International Criminal Court, 2023]."
