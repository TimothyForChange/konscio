  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since Russia's 2022 invasion, Ukraine suffers a devastating conflict, inflicting immense human suffering. Millions are displaced, cities destroyed, and tens of thousands killed.\n\nThe war is an act of brutal **Russian imperialism**, but inseparable from decades of **eastward NATO expansion**. It is a catastrophic outcome of **inter-imperialist rivalry**, turning Ukraine into a **proxy battleground**. Massive **Western arms flows** sustain the war but also deepen Ukraine's **dependency** and integrate it into a Western-dominated structure, with Ukrainians paying the price. This **disaster capitalism** framework shapes the ongoing conflict and planned reconstruction.",

    "legacy": "Ukraine's history is marked by its position between **competing empires**. Subjected to the **Russian Empire** (colonial **Russification**) and later the **USSR** (centralised control, purges, **Holodomor** famine), this history informs both national identity and Russia's **neo-imperial** claims.\n\nFollowing the USSR's collapse, the **US/NATO** engaged in **triumphalist eastward expansion**, treating Eastern Europe as a strategic frontier, breaking assurances to Soviet leaders, and encircling Russia. This expansion created the **structural conditions** for conflict by ignoring security red lines."

      "description": "The post-**Cold War expansion of NATO** was a primary driver of the crisis. Framed by the West as defensive, Russia perceived it as **aggressive encroachment**. This relentless **military expansion**, against warnings, created a **zero-sum security dilemma** shattering European peace and contributing directly to Russia's invasion decision."

Rapid **mass privatisation** allowed politically connected **oligarchs** to accumulate vast wealth. This process **hollowed out the state**, created corruption, made economies **dependent** on raw material exports, and vulnerable to **external pressures**. The conflict is partly a struggle between these rival **oligarchic capitalist states**."

These included severe **austerity**, **privatisation**, and opening Ukraine's agricultural land market. Often conditions for **Western financial aid**, these policies deepened **economic dependency** and created social hardship."

Western partners plan a post-war reconstruction explicitly along **neoliberal lines**, funded by loans locking Ukraine into decades of **debt** to **international financial institutions**. This prioritises **privatisation** and opportunities for **foreign corporations**. The war serves as a **geopolitical battleground** and a mechanism for restructuring Ukraine's economy for **Western capital**."

Simultaneously, critics note the **selective application of international law** by Western powers, who engaged in illegal invasions (**Iraq, Libya**) without facing **accountability**, weakening the legal order they invoke."
