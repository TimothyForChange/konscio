  "currentCrisisSummary": "A fragile peace following the 2020-2022 Tigray War has left a legacy of mass atrocities, a man-made famine, and ethnic cleansing [Amnesty International & HRW, 2022]. The conflict represents a brutal contest over the country's political and economic future, pitting a state-led development model against a push for neoliberal liberalisation. Eritrean and Amhara forces continue to occupy parts of Tigray, preventing the return of the displaced.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Ethiopian Empire & subsequent centralist states",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis stems from its history as an empire-state. The centralising Abyssinian core, primarily Amhara elites, expanded through conquest, creating a system of internal colonialism [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) addressed this through ethnic federalism and a state-capitalist development model that, while reducing poverty, also concentrated wealth within a new political class. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's recentralising project, championed by international financial institutions, seeks to dismantle both the federal system and the state-led economy in favour of privatisation and foreign investment, triggering a violent conflict over the fundamental nature of the state."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The war was a violent struggle over the soul of the state. It pitted multinational federalismâ€”which grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nationsâ€”against a unitarist ideology seeking a centralised identity. Economically, it is a fight over resources and development. Federalism allows regions to manage their own economic destinies, while centralism concentrates that power, making it easier for a national elite to strike deals with foreign capital and international financial institutions.",
    "weaponisedGrievancesAndForeignIntervention": "Abiy's government ignited the conflict by weaponising historical grievances. Amhara expansionists, seeking to annex fertile land in Western Tigray, allied with the federal government. Externally, Eritrea's dictator Isaias Afwerki joined the invasion, committing some of the war's worst atrocities [Amnesty International, 2021]. The use of foreign drones (from the UAE, Turkey, and China)â€”sold for profit and to advance the buyers' own geostrategic and economic interestsâ€”turned a constitutional dispute into a high-tech proxy war."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 2.6 million people were internally displaced at the war's peak, with hundreds of thousands still unable to return to their occupied homes [IOM, 2022].",
    "refugees": "More than 95,000 refugees, mostly women and children, were forced to flee into neighbouring Sudan [UNHCR, 2021].",
    "casualties": "An estimated 300,000 to 600,000 civilians died, the vast majority from starvation and lack of medicine caused by a deliberate government siege [Ghent University, 2022; Olusegun Obasanjo, 2023].",
    "affected": "The war left 5.2 million people in Tigrayâ€”90% of the populationâ€”in need of life-saving aid. Sexual violence was also used as a weapon of war on a mass scale [UN, 2021]."
