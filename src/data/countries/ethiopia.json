  "currentCrisisSummary": "Ethiopia faces multiple humanitarian catastrophes stemming from the **violent breakdown** of its **ethnic federalist political system** and the unresolved legacies of its **internal imperial formation**. The country reels from the devastating 2020-2022 Tigray war while confronting large-scale armed conflicts between the federal government and regional forces in Amhara and Oromia.\n\nThese conflicts represent a catastrophic failure to resolve political questions rooted in historical grievances. Instead, **brutal military force** has resulted in mass displacement, atrocities, service collapse, and acute food insecurity. This is not merely ethnic strife but a **deep structural crisis of the Ethiopian state**, exacerbated by **external geopolitical interests** vying for influence.",

    "legacy": "The modern Ethiopian state formed through **internal imperial expansion**. The Amhara-dominated centre conquered southern peoples, creating a multi-ethnic '**prison of nations**'. Grievances from this **violent state formation** (land, language, subjugation) are the root of today's conflicts.\n\nThis was layered with external pressures: Italian **colonial occupation** and **Cold War patronage**. The US-backed monarchy and Soviet-backed Derg regime used **foreign military aid** to suppress dissent, militarising the state."

Managed for decades through **authoritarian dominance** (TPLF-led), the current PM's **centralising reforms** shattered this balance, leading to clashes over autonomy. The wars are a direct result of this model's **violent collapse**."
