  "currentCrisisSummary": "While a fragile peace holds in Tigray, Ethiopia is engulfed by a devastating war in the Amhara region and ongoing conflict in Oromia. The war in Amhara, which erupted in 2023, pits the federal government against the Fano militia, its former allies. This new conflict, marked by brutal drone warfare and a state of emergency, has triggered a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. These wars represent a violent breakdown of the state, compounding the unresolved trauma of the 2020-2022 Tigray war and creating millions of newly displaced people.",
  "imperialRoot": {
    "imperialPower": "Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinian expansion, c. 12th-20th centuries)",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis is rooted in its legacy as an empire-state. The historical Abyssinian core expanded through conquest, creating a system of internal colonial domination that subjugated numerous ethnic groups under a centralised highland elite [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) attempted to address this through multinational federalism and a state-led development model. While this reduced poverty, it also concentrated wealth within a new political elite. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's centralising projectâ€”which aligns with the privatisation goals of international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bankâ€”threatens to dismantle this federal system. These institutions favour centralisation as it simplifies the imposition of neoliberal reforms, such as the selling-off of state assets, with minimal regional opposition. This clash over the state's structure and economic soul was a key trigger for the recent wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The conflicts are fundamentally a struggle over the structure of the Ethiopian state. They pit multinational federalismâ€”which constitutionally grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nationsâ€”against a unitarist ideology aiming to re-establish a centralised identity. This political struggle has a critical economic dimension: federalism allows regions greater control over their resources, whereas centralism consolidates economic power, simplifying the process for a national elite to implement privatisation and secure deals with foreign capital.",
    "weaponisedGrievancesAndForeignIntervention": "The federal government's strategy involves shifting, opportunistic alliances. After allying with Amhara forces to crush the TPLF, its move to dissolve regional forces was seen as a betrayal, igniting the current war. In these conflicts, the widespread use of foreign drones (from the UAE, Turkey, and China) transforms internal political disputes into high-tech wars, causing immense civilian devastation. This is a key feature of modern neo-imperialism, where drone sales provide profit and geostrategic leverage, turning the Global South into a testing ground for advanced weaponry."
