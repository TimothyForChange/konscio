  "currentCrisisSummary": "While a fragile peace holds in Tigray, Ethiopia is now engulfed by a devastating war in the Amhara region and ongoing conflict in Oromia. The war in Amhara, which erupted in 2023, pits the federal government against the Fano militia, its former allies in the Tigray War. This new conflict, marked by brutal drone warfare and a state of emergency, has triggered a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, creating millions of newly displaced people and compounding the unresolved trauma of the 2020-2022 war.",

    "colonialPower": "Ethiopian Empire",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis is rooted in its history as an empire-state. The historical Abyssinian core expanded through conquest, creating a system of internal colonialism that marginalised numerous ethnic groups [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) addressed this with a model of multinational federalism and state-led development, which reduced poverty but also saw wealth concentrated within a new political elite. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's recentralising projectâ€”which aligns with the privatisation goals of international financial institutionsâ€”threatens to dismantle this federal system. This clash over the state's structure and economic direction was a key trigger for both the Tigray and Amhara wars."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The conflicts are fundamentally a struggle over the structure of the Ethiopian state. They pit multinational federalismâ€”which constitutionally grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nationsâ€”against a unitarist ideology aiming to re-establish a centralised identity. This political struggle has a critical economic dimension: federalism allows regions greater control over their resources, whereas centralism consolidates economic power, simplifying the process for a national elite to implement privatisation and secure deals with foreign capital.",
    "weaponisedGrievancesAndForeignIntervention": "The federal government's strategy involves shifting, opportunistic alliances. After allying with Amhara forces to crush the TPLF, the government's subsequent move to dissolve regional forces was seen as a betrayal in Amhara, igniting the current war. In both conflicts, the widespread use of foreign drones (from the UAE, Turkey, and China)â€”sold for profit and geostrategic leverageâ€”has transformed internal political disputes into high-tech wars, causing immense civilian devastation."
