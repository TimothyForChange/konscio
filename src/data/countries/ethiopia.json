  "currentCrisisSummary": "While a fragile peace holds in Tigray, Ethiopia is facing a devastating war in the Amhara region and ongoing conflict in Oromia. The war in Amhara, which erupted in 2023, pits the federal government against the Fano militia, its former allies. This new conflict, marked by the use of drone warfare and a state of emergency, has triggered a severe humanitarian crisis. These wars represent a serious challenge to the state, compounding the unresolved tensions of the 2020-2022 Tigray war and creating millions of newly displaced people.",

    "imperialPower": "Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinian expansion, c. 12th-20th centuries)",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis is rooted in its history as an empire-state. The historical Abyssinian core expanded through conquest, creating a system where numerous ethnic groups were incorporated under a centralised highland administration [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) attempted to address this through multinational federalism and a state-led development model. While this reduced poverty, it also led to wealth concentration within a new political elite. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's centralising project, which includes economic reforms favoured by international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, is seen by some as a threat to this federal system. These institutions often favour centralisation as it can simplify the implementation of economic reforms, such as the privatisation of state assets. This clash over the state's structure and economic direction was a key trigger for the recent wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The conflicts are a fundamental struggle over the structure of the Ethiopian state. They pit multinational federalismâ€”which constitutionally grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nationsâ€”against a unitarist ideology aiming to re-establish a more centralised identity. This political struggle has a critical economic dimension: federalism allows regions greater control over their resources, whereas centralism consolidates economic power, which can simplify the process for a national elite to implement privatisation and secure deals with foreign investors.",
    "shiftingAlliancesAndForeignIntervention": "The federal government's strategy has involved shifting alliances. After allying with Amhara forces to crush the TPLF, its move to dissolve regional forces was seen as a betrayal by its former allies, igniting the current war. In these conflicts, the widespread use of foreign drones (from the UAE, Turkey, and China) has transformed internal political disputes into high-tech conflicts, causing immense civilian devastation. Critics describe this as a feature of modern foreign policy, where drone sales provide profit and geostrategic leverage, turning conflict zones into testing grounds for advanced weaponry."
