  "currentCrisisSummary": "A fragile peace following the 2020-2022 Tigray War has left a legacy of mass atrocities, widespread famine, and ethnic cleansing [Amnesty International & HRW, 2022], with occupying forces still present in parts of the region.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Ethiopian Empire & subsequent centralist states",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis stems from its history as an empire-state. The centralising Abyssinian core, primarily Amhara elites, expanded through conquest, imposing a unitary identity and suppressing the cultures of conquered peoples like the Oromo, Somali, and others. This internal colonialism created deep-seated grievances [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) addressed this through ethnic federalism, granting self-rule to different nations. However, the rise of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his recentralising 'Medemer' ideology represented a direct assault on this federal system, triggering a violent conflict over the fundamental nature of the Ethiopian state."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The war was a violent struggle over the soul of the state. It pitted the principle of ethnic federalism—which grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nations as enshrined in the 1995 constitution—against a resurgent unitarist ideology that seeks to impose a centralised, homogenous national identity. For Tigray and other marginalised groups, federalism is non-negotiable protection; for centralists, it is a threat to unity.",
    "weaponisedGrievancesAndForeignIntervention": "The conflict was ignited by weaponising historical grievances. Amhara elites, seeking to reclaim territories like Welkait (Western Tigray), allied with the federal government. This alliance provided the domestic justification for the invasion. Externally, Eritrea's dictator Isaias Afwerki, driven by a long-standing vendetta against the TPLF, joined the invasion, and his forces committed some of the war's worst atrocities [Amnesty International, 2021; HRW, 2021]. This turned an internal constitutional dispute into a devastating regional war."

    "displaced": "Over 2.6 million people were internally displaced at the war's peak, with hundreds of thousands still unable to return home [IOM, 2022].",
    "refugees": "More than 95,000 refugees, mostly women and children, were forced to flee into neighbouring Sudan [UNHCR, 2021].",
    "casualties": "An estimated 300,000 to 600,000 civilians died from direct killing, starvation, and lack of medicine due to a deliberate siege [Ghent University, 2022; Olusegun Obasanjo, 2023].",
    "affected": "The war left 5.2 million people in Tigray—90% of the population—in need of life-saving humanitarian aid [UN OCHA, 2022]."
