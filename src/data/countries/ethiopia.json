  "currentCrisisSummary": "A fragile peace following the 2020-2022 Tigray War has left a legacy of mass atrocities, a man-made famine, and ethnic cleansing [Amnesty International & HRW, 2022]. Eritrean and Amhara forces continue to occupy parts of Tigray, preventing the return of the displaced and entrenching the gains of the war.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Ethiopian Empire & subsequent centralist states",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis stems from its history as an empire-state. The centralising Abyssinian core, primarily Amhara elites, expanded through conquest, imposing a unitary identity and suppressing the cultures of conquered peoples like the Oromo, Somali, and others. This internal colonialism created deep-seated grievances [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) addressed this legacy through ethnic federalism, granting self-rule to different 'nations, nationalities, and peoples'. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's recentralising 'Medemer' ideology is a modern iteration of this imperial project, representing a direct assault on the federal system and triggering a violent conflict over the fundamental nature of the state."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The war was a violent struggle over the soul of the state. It pitted the principle of multinational federalismâ€”which grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nations as enshrined in the 1995 constitutionâ€”against a resurgent unitarist ideology that seeks to impose a centralised, homogenous national identity. For Tigray and other marginalised groups, federalism is non-negotiable protection; for centralists, it is a threat to unity.",
    "weaponisedGrievancesAndForeignIntervention": "Abiy's government and its allies ignited the conflict by weaponising historical grievances. Amhara expansionists, seeking to annex territories like Welkait (Western Tigray), allied with the federal government. Externally, Eritrea's dictator Isaias Afwerki, driven by a vendetta against the TPLF, joined the invasion, and his forces committed some of the war's worst atrocities [Amnesty International, 2021; HRW, 2021]. The use of foreign drones (from the UAE, Turkey, and China) further devastated civilian areas, turning a constitutional dispute into a high-tech regional war."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 2.6 million people were internally displaced at the war's peak, with hundreds of thousands still unable to return to their occupied homes [IOM, 2022].",
    "refugees": "More than 95,000 refugees, mostly women and children, were forced to flee into neighbouring Sudan [UNHCR, 2021].",
    "casualties": "An estimated 300,000 to 600,000 civilians died, the vast majority from starvation and lack of medicine caused by a deliberate government siege [Ghent University, 2022; Olusegun Obasanjo, 2023].",
    "affected": "The war left 5.2 million people in Tigrayâ€”90% of the populationâ€”in need of life-saving aid. Sexual violence was also used as a weapon of war on a mass scale [UN, 2021]."
