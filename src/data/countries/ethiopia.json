  "currentCrisisSummary": "A fragile peace follows the 2020-2022 Tigray War, which was marked by mass atrocities, a famine widely described as man-made, and acts of ethnic cleansing [Amnesty International & HRW, 2022]. The conflict was a violent struggle over Ethiopia's political and economic future, pitting the established state-led development model against a centralising agenda of neoliberal reform. Eritrean and Amhara forces continue to occupy parts of Tigray, obstructing the return of displaced people.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Ethiopian Empire & subsequent centralist states",
    "legacy": "Ethiopia's crisis is rooted in its history as an empire-state. The historical Abyssinian core expanded through conquest, creating a system of internal colonialism that marginalised numerous ethnic groups [Donald N. Levine, 2000]. The TPLF-led government (1991-2018) addressed this with a model of multinational federalism and state-led development, which reduced poverty but also saw wealth concentrated within a new political elite. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's recentralising projectâ€”which aligns with the privatisation goals of international financial institutionsâ€”threatens to dismantle this federal system. This clash over the state's structure and economic direction was a key trigger for the conflict."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "federalismVsCentralism": "The war was fundamentally a conflict over the structure of the Ethiopian state. It pitted multinational federalismâ€”which constitutionally grants self-determination to Ethiopia's diverse nationsâ€”against a unitarist ideology aiming to re-establish a centralised identity. This political struggle has a critical economic dimension: federalism allows regions greater control over their resources and development, whereas centralism consolidates economic power, simplifying the process for a national elite to implement privatisation and secure deals with foreign capital.",
    "weaponisedGrievancesAndForeignIntervention": "The federal government mobilised support for the war by inflaming historical grievances, particularly by allying with Amhara expansionist ambitions over territory in Western Tigray. The conflict was internationalised from the start, as Eritrea's dictator Isaias Afwerkiâ€”a long-time foe of the TPLFâ€”invaded in concert with federal forces, committing some of the war's worst atrocities [Amnesty International, 2021]. The widespread use of foreign drones (from the UAE, Turkey, and China) transformed a political and constitutional dispute into a high-tech war with multiple international actors pursuing their own geostrategic interests."

    "displaced": "Over 2.6 million people were internally displaced at the war's peak, with hundreds of thousands still unable to return to their occupied homes [IOM, 2022].",
    "refugees": "More than 95,000 refugees, mostly women and children, were forced to flee into neighbouring Sudan [UNHCR, 2021].",
    "casualties": "An estimated 300,000 to 600,000 civilians died, the vast majority from starvation and lack of medicine caused by a deliberate government siege [Ghent University, 2022; Olusegun Obasanjo, 2023].",
    "affected": "The war left 5.2 million people in Tigrayâ€”90% of the populationâ€”in need of life-saving aid. Sexual violence was also used as a weapon of war on a mass scale [UN, 2021].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over 1.5 million children were out of school due to conflict and destruction of educational infrastructure [UNICEF, 2022]."
