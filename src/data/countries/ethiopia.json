  "currentCrisisSummary": "Ethiopia faces multiple humanitarian catastrophes stemming from the **violent breakdown** of its **ethnic federalist political system** and the unresolved legacies of its **internal imperial formation**. The country reels from the devastating 2020-2022 Tigray war while confronting large-scale armed conflicts between the federal government and regional forces in Amhara and Oromia.\n\nThese conflicts represent a **catastrophic failure** to resolve political questions of autonomy and power, rooted in historical grievances, through negotiation. Instead, **brutal military force** has resulted in mass displacement, widespread atrocities, service collapse, and acute food insecurity. This is not merely ethnic strife but a **deep structural crisis of the Ethiopian state**, exacerbated by **external geopolitical interests** vying for influence in the Horn of Africa.",

    "legacy": "The modern Ethiopian state was largely formed through a process of **internal imperial expansion** in the late 19th century. Under emperors like Menelik II, the Amhara-dominated centre conquered and forcibly incorporated diverse southern peoples, creating a multi-ethnic '**prison of nations**' held together by a centralised, authoritarian structure. The historical grievances stemming from this **violent state formation**â€”over land, language, and political subjugationâ€”are the primary root of today's conflicts.\n\nThis internal legacy was layered with external pressures: a brief but disruptive Italian **colonial occupation** and, more significantly, **Cold War patronage**. The US-backed monarchy and the subsequent Soviet-backed Derg regime both used **foreign military aid** to suppress internal dissent and wage wars, further militarising the state and entrenching a culture of violent political consolidation."

    {
      "title": "The Failure of Ethnic Federalism",
      "description": "The 1995 constitution established a system of **ethnic federalism**, an ambitious attempt to resolve the historical 'national question'. For decades, this system was managed through the **authoritarian dominance** of the TPLF-led coalition. The current Prime Minister's **centralising reforms** shattered this balance, leading to a violent clash between the federal government and regional autonomy demands. The wars in Tigray, Amhara, and Oromia are the direct result of this model's **violent collapse**."

      "title": "From Developmental State to Neoliberal Shock Therapy",
      "description": "While Ethiopia was long a model of a '**developmental state**' reliant on **foreign aid**, since 2018 it has undergone a rapid **neoliberal transition**. The government pursued **privatisation** (telecoms), **financial deregulation**, and attracting **foreign capital**. This **economic 'shock therapy'** is also a political project to dismantle the old ruling coalition's economic power. The resulting struggle for control over economic resources is a key driver of the current civil wars."

    {
      "title": "Land Grabs and Rural Dispossession",
      "description": "Ethiopia experiences widespread '**land grabs**'. Under both the developmental state and **neoliberal** models, vast tracts of fertile land (Oromia, Gambella) have been leased to **foreign corporations** for agribusiness. This often involves **violent dispossession** of local communities, undermining livelihoods and food security, representing a modern form of **resource extraction** that fuels resentment against the central state."

    {
      "title": "Geopolitics of the Horn and Proxy Interests",
      "description": "Ethiopia is a focal point of intense **geopolitical competition**. **External actors** (Eritrea, UAE, Turkey, US, China) pursue strategic interests through military and economic means. **Foreign drones** (notably from UAE) were decisive in the Tigray war and continue to fuel conflicts. These **interventions** provide tools for war and prioritise external goals (Red Sea control, Nile influence) over peace."
