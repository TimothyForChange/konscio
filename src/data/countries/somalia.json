  "currentCrisisSummary": "Somalia is caught in a convergence of catastrophic crises: a protracted civil war, a resilient al-Shabaab insurgency, and a devastating cycle of climate-driven droughts and floods. This perfect storm has led to a near-permanent state of humanitarian emergency, with millions displaced and facing one of the world's most severe hunger crises [UN OCHA, 2025].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain & Italy",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of the colonial partition of the Somali nation. In the 'Scramble for Africa', Britain and Italy (along with France) carved up a culturally and linguistically homogenous people into five separate territories, shattering its social and economic fabric. The artificial borders and the hasty, ill-planned merger of the British and Italian colonies at independence in 1960 created a dysfunctional state from its inception [I.M. Lewis, 'A Modern History of the Somali', 2002]. This colonial vivisection and the failure to address the 'national question' of a divided people created the deep-seated grievances that have fuelled decades of conflict."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theFragmentedState": "The state's implosion in 1991 was a direct result of its colonial creation being supercharged by the Cold War. The Siad Barre dictatorship was armed and propped up first by the Soviet Union and then the United States, who used Somalia as a geopolitical pawn. This external support for a hyper-centralised, violent state crushed organic political development. After its collapse, foreign interventionsâ€”from the failed US-led UN mission in the 1990s to the modern 'war on terror' frameworkâ€”have often exacerbated fragmentation, prioritising counter-terrorism over a genuine, Somali-led process of national reconciliation and state-building.",
    "climateCatastropheAndPermanentCrisis": "Somalia is a ground-zero for climate injustice. Despite having negligible carbon emissions, it is suffering from record-breaking droughts and catastrophic floods driven by the climate crisis created by the Global North. This ecological collapse has decimated pastoral and agricultural livelihoods, acting as a primary driver of mass displacement and a powerful recruitment tool for armed groups like al-Shabaab, which exploits the resulting desperation. Climate change has transformed a political crisis into a permanent, self-perpetuating humanitarian catastrophe, where cycles of famine are now a predictable feature."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Nearly 4 million people are internally displaced by conflict and climate shocks [UNHCR, 2025].",
    "refugees": "Over 1 million Somalis live as refugees and asylum-seekers, primarily in neighbouring Kenya, Ethiopia, and Yemen [UNHCR, O2025].",
    "casualties": "While no definitive figure exists for the entire civil war, an estimated 500,000 people have died from violent conflict-related causes since 1991. The 2011 famine alone killed an estimated 260,000 people [UN/USAID, 2013].",
    "affected": "An estimated 8.3 million people require life-saving humanitarian assistance, with over 6.6 million facing acute food insecurity [UN OCHA, 2025]."
