  "currentCrisisSummary": "Somalia faces a convergence of severe, interlocking crises: a protracted civil war, an entrenched al-Shabaab insurgency, and repeated climate-driven droughts and floods that have devastated livelihoods.\n\nThese dynamics â€” amplified by geopolitical competition, external military interventions and extractive practices such as illegal fishing and contested resource claims â€” have produced a long-term humanitarian emergency. Millions are displaced, public services are fragile or non-functional in many areas, and food and nutrition emergencies recur with alarming frequency.\n\nHumanitarian response is repeatedly undermined by access constraints, funding shortfalls and insecurity. A Somali-led political solution, protection of civilian space, and large-scale, locally accountable humanitarian and climate adaptation support are essential to prevent repeated cycles of famine and displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain & Italy (c. 1880s-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in the colonial partitioning of Somali-inhabited lands during the Scramble for Africa. Britain, Italy (and France in neighbouring territories) divided a culturally and linguistically cohesive people into separate political entities and imposed artificial borders that disrupted traditional economic and social systems.\n\nThe rushed post-colonial merger of former British and Italian territories in 1960 left a state with unresolved territorial, clan and governance tensions, a fragility that was later compounded by Cold War geopolitics and frequent external interventions."
  },
  "historicalContext": {
    "theFragmentedState": "The collapse of central authority in 1991 unfolded in a Cold War context where Siad Barre's regime had been alternately supported by the USSR and the United States. The post-collapse period saw repeated external interventions â€” from humanitarian missions in the 1990s to later counter-terrorism operations â€” that too often prioritised military objectives over Somali-led political settlement and resilient local governance.\n\nThis chronic fragmentation created vacuums that armed groups exploited and left Somali institutions weakened and highly dependent on external finance and security architectures.",
    "climateChangeAndEconomicExploitation": "Somalia is on the frontline of climate change: repeated failed rainy seasons, prolonged droughts and sudden floods have destroyed crops, killed livestock and deepened food insecurity. At the same time, the state's collapse opened space for illicit economic activity: illegal fishing by foreign fleets and documented toxic-waste dumping have eroded coastal livelihoods, while new competition for offshore resources risks generating fresh conflict dynamics.\n\nThese interlocking drivers â€” climate shocks, resource predation and political fragmentation â€” create what many analysts describe as ecological and economic injustice: the global north's emissions and commercial practices impose heavy costs on Somali communities."
  },
  "internationalLawAndAccountability": "International responsibility is contested and partial. Human rights organisations, UN panels and investigative journalists have repeatedly documented abuses by state and non-state actors, including violations of humanitarian law in counter-insurgency operations and patterns of exploitation by transnational actors. Accountability mechanisms exist unevenly; strengthening independent documentation, protection of witnesses and Somali-centred transitional justice processes remains a priority.",
  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "About 3.5 million people are internally displaced by conflict and climate shocks, living in camps, informal sites and host communities with precarious access to services.",
    "refugees": "Approximately 714,000 Somali refugees and asylum-seekers are hosted in neighbouring countries (Kenya, Ethiopia, Yemen and others), with protracted protection needs.",
    "casualties": "Estimates of conflict-related deaths since 1991 vary by methodology and period. Large-scale mortality from war, famine and disease has periodically reached the hundreds of thousands; the 2011 famine alone has been estimated at around 258,000 excess deaths in scientific surveys.",
    "affected": "Humanitarian planning documents and response plans for 2025 identify roughly 6-7.7 million people in need of assistance depending on the planning baseline used.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 3 million children are out of school because of conflict, displacement and damaged infrastructure, with long-term impacts on education and protection.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "Large parts of the public health system are severely weakened: recurrent disease outbreaks, limited access to maternal and child health, and shortages of medicines and personnel are widespread.",
    "foodInsecurity": "About 4.4 million people face high levels of acute food insecurity, with children and pastoralist communities especially at risk; nutrition assessments project roughly 1.7 million children at risk of acute malnutrition in 2025.",
    "lackOfWaterAccess": "More than half the population lacks reliable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in many affected areas, increasing risks of disease during droughts and floods."
