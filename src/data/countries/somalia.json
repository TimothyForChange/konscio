Millions are displaced, services disintegrated, and mass hunger recurs.\n\nAid efforts are hindered by insecurity. Preventing cycles of famine requires Somali-led political solutions, civilian protection, and large-scale **climate adaptation support** alongside **reparations for ecological damage**.",

In the 1980s, the indebted Barre regime accepted **IMF-led Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)**. These enforced **deregulation**, destroying farmers' livelihoods. Mandated **austerity** **hollowed out the state's** capacity, accelerating social breakdown."

The 2006 **US-backed Ethiopian invasion** ousted the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), shattered stability, and catalysed al-Shabaab's rise (**blowback**). Decades of **drone strikes**, **special forces operations**, and **proxy interventions** entrenched violence, undermining reconciliation."

New resource competition risks conflict. These drivers create **ecological and economic injustice**: the Global North's emissions and commercial practices impose heavy costs."
