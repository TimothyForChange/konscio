  "currentCrisisSummary": "Somalia endures **converging structural crises**: protracted civil war stemming from **state collapse induced by Cold War legacies and neoliberal policies**; an entrenched al-Shabaab insurgency born from **failed 'War on Terror' interventions**; and **climate catastrophe** (droughts, floods) devastating livelihoods.\n\nThese dynamicsâ€”amplified by **geopolitical competition, external military interference, and predatory extraction** (illegal fishing, resource claims)â€”**produce chronic, widespread suffering**. Millions are displaced, public services have disintegrated, and **mass hunger recurs frequently**.\n\nAid efforts are hindered by insecurity and access constraints. Preventing repeated cycles of famine and displacement requires **Somali-led political solutions**, civilian protection, and large-scale, locally accountable **climate adaptation support alongside reparations for ecological damage**.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain & Italy (c. 1880s-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in the colonial partitioning of Somali-inhabited lands during the Scramble for Africa. Britain, Italy (and France in neighbouring territories) divided a culturally and linguistically cohesive people into separate political entities and imposed artificial borders that disrupted traditional economic and social systems.\n\nThe rushed post-colonial merger of former British and Italian territories in 1960 left a state with unresolved territorial, clan and governance tensions, a fragility that was later compounded by Cold War geopolitics and frequent external interventions."

  "historicalContext": [
    {
      "title": "Neoliberalism and State Collapse",
      "description": "The 1991 state collapse was preceded by a severe economic crisis and neoliberal intervention. During the 1980s, the indebted Siad Barre regime was forced to accept IMF-led Structural Adjustment Programmes. These policies enforced the deregulation of grain markets, leading to a flood of cheap imports that destroyed the livelihoods of local farmers. The mandated austerity and cuts to public services hollowed out the state's capacity and legitimacy, accelerating the social breakdown that culminated in civil war."
    },
    {
      "title": "The Fragmented State",
      "description": "The collapse of central authority in 1991 unfolded in a Cold War context where Siad Barre's regime had been alternately supported by the USSR and the United States. The post-collapse period saw repeated external interventions that too often prioritised military objectives over Somali-led political settlement and resilient local governance."
    },
    {
      "title": "The War on Terror and the Rise of Al-Shabaab",
      "description": "The post-9/11 'Global War on Terror' framework became a primary driver of the conflict. The 2006 US-backed Ethiopian invasion, designed to oust the popular Islamic Courts Union (ICU) which had brought relative stability to Mogadishu, is a key example. This intervention shattered a period of local governance and, in a classic case of blowback, catalysed the rise of the ICU's more radical youth wing, al-Shabaab. The subsequent decades of drone strikes, special forces operations, and proxy interventions have entrenched a cycle of violence, where external counter-terrorism priorities consistently undermine the potential for genuine, Somali-led political reconciliation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Climate Change and Economic Exploitation",
      "description": "Somalia is on the frontline of climate change: repeated failed rainy seasons, prolonged droughts and sudden floods have destroyed crops, killed livestock and deepened food insecurity. At the same time, the state's collapse opened space for illicit economic activity: illegal fishing by foreign fleets and documented toxic-waste dumping have eroded coastal livelihoods, while new competition for offshore resources risks generating fresh conflict dynamics.\n\nThese interlocking drivers â€” climate shocks, resource predation and political fragmentation â€” create what many analysts describe as ecological and economic injustice: the global north's emissions and commercial practices impose heavy costs on Somali communities."
    },
    {
      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "International responsibility is contested and partial. Human rights organisations, UN panels and investigative journalists have repeatedly documented abuses by state and non-state actors, including violations of humanitarian law in counter-insurgency operations and patterns of exploitation by transnational actors. Accountability mechanisms exist unevenly; strengthening independent documentation, protection of witnesses and Somali-centred transitional justice processes remains a priority."
