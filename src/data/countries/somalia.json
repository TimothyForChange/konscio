  "currentCrisisSummary": "Somalia is caught in a convergence of severe crises: a protracted civil war, an al-Shabaab insurgency, and a cycle of climate-driven droughts and floods. This convergence, fuelled by geopolitical competition and climate change, has led to a long-term humanitarian emergency, with millions displaced and facing one of the world's most severe hunger crises.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain & Italy (c. 1880s-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of the colonial partition of Somali-inhabited lands. In the 'Scramble for Africa', Britain and Italy (along with France) divided a culturally and linguistically homogenous people into five separate territories, disrupting its social and economic fabric. The artificial borders and the hasty merger of the British and Italian colonies at independence in 1960 created challenges for the new state from its inception. This colonial division of a homogenous people created grievances that have fuelled decades of conflict."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theFragmentedState": "The state's collapse in 1991 was intensified by the Cold War. The Siad Barre dictatorship was armed first by the USSR and then the US, who saw Somalia as a strategic location for controlling sea lanes vital for global oil shipments. After its collapse, foreign interventionsâ€”from the US-led mission in the 1990s to the modern 'war on terror'â€”have often exacerbated fragmentation by prioritising external counter-terrorism goals over a Somali-led process of state-building.",
    "climateChangeAndEconomicExploitation": "Somalia is on the front line of crises linked to the global economic system. It suffers from the severe impacts of climate change, as droughts, linked to global emissions, damage livelihoods. Simultaneously, the state's collapse created a vacuum exploited by external actors: international fleets engaged in illegal fishing and companies reportedly dumped toxic waste. This resource exploitation is now being followed by corporate competition for offshore oil, which could create a new cycle of conflict."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Nearly 4 million people are internally displaced by conflict and climate shocks.",
    "refuges": "Nearly 1 million Somalis live as refugees and asylum-seekers, primarily in neighbouring Kenya, Ethiopia, and Yemen.",
    "casualties": "While no definitive figure exists for the entire civil war, an estimated 500,000 people have died from violent conflict-related causes since 1991. The 2011 famine alone killed an estimated 260,000 people.",
    "affected": "An estimated 7.7 million people require life-saving humanitarian assistance.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 3 million children are out of school due to conflict, displacement, and lack of educational infrastructure.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The healthcare system remains severely weakened, with recurrent disease outbreaks and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.",
    "foodInsecurity": "An estimated 4 million people face acute food insecurity, with 1.7 million children facing acute malnutrition.",
    "waterAccess": "More than half of the population lacks access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene."
