  "currentCrisisSummary": "Somalia endures converging **structural crises**: protracted civil war stemming from **state collapse induced by Cold War legacies and neoliberal policies**; an entrenched al-Shabaab insurgency born from **failed 'War on Terror' interventions**; and **climate catastrophe** (droughts, floods) devastating livelihoods.\n\nThese dynamicsâ€”amplified by **geopolitical competition**, **external military interference**, and **predatory extraction** (illegal fishing, resource claims)â€”produce chronic, widespread suffering. Millions are displaced, public services have disintegrated, and mass hunger recurs frequently.\n\nAid efforts are hindered by insecurity and access constraints. Preventing repeated cycles of famine and displacement requires Somali-led political solutions, civilian protection, and large-scale, locally accountable **climate adaptation support** alongside **reparations for ecological damage**.",

    "colonialPower": "Britain & Italy (c. 1880s-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in the **colonial partitioning** of Somali-inhabited lands during the **Scramble for Africa**. Britain, Italy (and France) divided a cohesive people into separate entities and imposed **artificial borders**, disrupting traditional systems.\n\nThe rushed post-colonial merger left a state with unresolved tensions, a fragility compounded by **Cold War geopolitics** and frequent **external interventions**."

    {
      "title": "Neoliberalism and State Collapse",
      "description": "The 1991 **state collapse** was preceded by economic crisis and **neoliberal intervention**. During the 1980s, the indebted Siad Barre regime accepted **IMF-led Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)**. These policies enforced **deregulation** of grain markets, flooding them with cheap imports that destroyed local farmers' livelihoods. Mandated **austerity** and cuts to public services **hollowed out the state's** capacity and legitimacy, accelerating the social breakdown."

    {
      "title": "The Fragmented State",
      "description": "The **collapse of central authority** in 1991 unfolded in a **Cold War** context (Barre supported by USSR then US). The post-collapse period saw repeated **external interventions** that often prioritised military objectives over Somali-led political settlement."

    {
      "title": "The War on Terror and the Rise of Al-Shabaab",
      "description": "The post-9/11 '**Global War on Terror**' framework became a primary driver of conflict. The 2006 **US-backed Ethiopian invasion**, designed to oust the popular Islamic Courts Union (ICU), shattered stability and catalysed the rise of al-Shabaab (**blowback**). Subsequent decades of **drone strikes**, **special forces operations**, and **proxy interventions** entrenched violence, undermining Somali-led reconciliation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Climate Change and Economic Exploitation",
      "description": "Somalia is on the frontline of **climate change**: droughts and floods destroy livelihoods and deepen food insecurity. **State collapse** opened space for illicit activity: **illegal fishing** by foreign fleets and **toxic-waste dumping** eroded coastal livelihoods. New competition for offshore resources risks fresh conflict. These driversâ€”**climate shocks**, **resource predation**, fragmentationâ€”create **ecological and economic injustice**: the Global North's emissions and commercial practices impose heavy costs."

    {
      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "**International responsibility** is contested. Abuses by state/non-state actors, violations in counter-insurgency, and **exploitation by transnational actors** are documented. **Accountability** mechanisms are uneven; strengthening independent documentation and Somali-centred **transitional justice** is key."
