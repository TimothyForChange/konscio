  "currentCrisisSummary": "Somalia is caught in a convergence of catastrophic crises: a protracted civil war, a resilient al-Shabaab insurgency, and a devastating cycle of climate-driven droughts and floods. This perfect storm, fuelled by the predatory logic of global resource competition and climate injustice, has led to a near-permanent state of humanitarian emergency, with millions displaced and facing one of the world's most severe hunger crises [UN OCHA, 2025].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain & Italy",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of the colonial partition of the Somali nation. In the 'Scramble for Africa', Britain and Italy (along with France) carved up a culturally and linguistically homogenous people into five separate territories, shattering its social and economic fabric. The artificial borders and the hasty, ill-planned merger of the British and Italian colonies at independence in 1960 created a dysfunctional state from its inception [I.M. Lewis, 'A Modern History of the Somali', 2002]. This colonial vivisection created the deep-seated grievances that have fuelled decades of conflict."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theFragmentedState": "The state's implosion in 1991 was supercharged by the Cold War. The Siad Barre dictatorship was armed first by the USSR and then the US, who used Somalia as a pawn to control the strategic sea lanes vital for global oil shipments. After its collapse, foreign interventionsâ€”from the failed US-led mission to the modern 'war on terror', a profitable industry for the Western security-industrial complexâ€”have often exacerbated fragmentation, prioritising counter-terrorism over a genuine, Somali-led process of state-building.",
    "climateColonialismAndPredatoryCapitalism": "Somalia is ground-zero for crises driven by global capitalism. Firstly, it suffers extreme climate injustice; catastrophic droughts and floods caused by the Global North's emissions decimate livelihoods and fuel conflict. Secondly, with the state's collapse, its unguarded coastline became a frontier for predatory extraction, with international fleets engaging in illegal fishing and Western companies dumping toxic waste with impunity. This plunder is now being followed by a corporate scramble for offshore oil and gas, threatening a new cycle of extractive conflict."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Nearly 4 million people are internally displaced by conflict and climate shocks [UNHCR, 2025].",
    "refugees": "Over 1 million Somalis live as refugees and asylum-seekers, primarily in neighbouring Kenya, Ethiopia, and Yemen [UNHCR, O2025].",
    "casualties": "While no definitive figure exists for the entire civil war, an estimated 500,000 people have died from violent conflict-related causes since 1991. The 2011 famine alone killed an estimated 260,000 people [UN/USAID, 2013].",
    "affected": "An estimated 8.3 million people require life-saving humanitarian assistance, with over 6.6 million facing acute food insecurity [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "More than 1.5 million children are out of school due to conflict, displacement, and lack of educational infrastructure [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The healthcare system remains weak with only 50% of health facilities functional due to decades of conflict and underfunding [WHO, 2023].",
    "foodInsecurity": "More than 6.5 million people face acute food insecurity, with over 1 million in catastrophic hunger [WFP, 2024].",
    "waterAccess": "More than 4 million people lack access to safe drinking water due to damaged infrastructure and recurrent droughts [UNICEF, 2023]."
