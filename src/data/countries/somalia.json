Millions are displaced, services disintegrated, and mass hunger recurs.",

    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in the **colonial partitioning** during the **Scramble for Africa**. Britain, Italy (and France) divided a cohesive people with **artificial borders**, disrupting traditional systems and creating distinct administrative legacies (e.g., Somaliland vs. Southern Somalia).\n\nThe rushed post-colonial merger left unresolved tensions over power-sharing and regional autonomy, compounded by **Cold War geopolitics** and frequent **external interventions**."

    {
      "title": "Neoliberalism and State Collapse",
      "description": "The 1991 **state collapse** was preceded by economic crisis and **neoliberal intervention**. In the 1980s, the indebted Barre regime accepted **IMF-led Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)**. These enforced **deregulation**, destroying farmers' livelihoods. Mandated **austerity** **hollowed out the state's** capacity, accelerating social breakdown."

    {
      "title": "Internal Fragmentation: Clan, Regions, and Federalism",
      "description": "**State collapse** allowed pre-existing **clan identities** to become the primary basis for political mobilisation and conflict. This led to the *de facto* independence of **Somaliland** (1991) and the autonomy of **Puntland** (1998). The internationally-backed **Federal Government (FGS)** struggles for legitimacy against powerful **Federal Member States (FMS)**, often fuelled by competing **clan interests** and external patrons."

      "title": "The War on Terror and the Rise of Al-Shabaab",
      "description": "The post-9/11 '**Global War on Terror**' framework drove conflict. The 2006 **US-backed Ethiopian invasion** ousted the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), shattered stability, and catalysed al-Shabaab's rise (**blowback**). Decades of **drone strikes**, **special forces operations**, and **proxy interventions** entrenched violence, undermining reconciliation."

      "title": "AMISOM/ATMIS: Intervention and Complicity",
      "description": "The dominant security actor since 2007 has been the **AU Mission (AMISOM/ATMIS)**, largely funded by the West. While preventing total state collapse, this massive military intervention (primarily by neighbouring states) has been criticised for **civilian casualties**, **sexual exploitation**, propping up weak governments, failing to defeat al-Shabaab, and becoming part of the **external interference** landscape."

These powers funnel funds, arms, and training to competing Somali factions and security forces, pursuing strategic interests (ports, resources, ideology) and exacerbating **internal fragmentation**."

    {
      "title": "Climate Change and Economic Exploitation",
      "description": "Somalia is on the frontline of **climate change**: droughts/floods destroy livelihoods. **State collapse** enabled illicit activity: **illegal fishing** by foreign fleets and **toxic-waste dumping** eroded coastal livelihoods. New resource competition risks conflict. These drivers create **ecological and economic injustice**: the Global North's emissions and commercial practices impose heavy costs."
