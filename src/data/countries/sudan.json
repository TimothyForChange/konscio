  "currentCrisisSummary": "Sudan is engulfed in a brutal civil war between two **predatory military factions** (SAF & RSF), unleashing the world's largest **displacement crisis** and **mass famine**. The conflict has triggered widespread atrocities and renewed **ethnic cleansing in Darfur** (primarily targeting **Masalit** and other non-Arab groups by the **RSF** and allied Arab militias), a region historically marginalised since the **colonial era**.\n\nThe warring elites compete for control of **economic spoils** (gold, land, **external patronage**), inflicting a catastrophic humanitarian collapse. Acute hunger affects millions, health systems collapse, and aid is deliberately obstructed. This war is actively sustained by **rival external actors** (esp. **Egypt backing SAF**, **UAE backing RSF**), transnational **arms flows**, and the failure of international systems to enforce **accountability**.",

    "colonialPower": "Britain & Egypt (1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "**British colonial governance** used **divide-and-rule**, concentrating power in the north while **marginalising peripheries** like Darfur. This **structural inequality** institutionalised grievance and set groundwork for rebellions.\n\nPrivileging the centre created a centralised, **extractive state** whose control over resources became the prize of military competition post-independence."

      "title": "Neoliberalism and the Roots of Revolution",
      "description": "Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule embraced a harsh **neoliberal economic model**. Under pressure from **US sanctions** and the **IMF**, his regime **privatised** assets, slashed subsidies, and encouraged '**land grabs**' by **foreign investors**. This policy of **austerity** and **resource extraction** enriched elites while impoverishing the population. The 2019 revolution was triggered by bread prices, a result of these **neoliberal policies**. The subsequent transitional government was pressured into '**shock therapy**', whose painful consequences contributed to the 2021 **military coup**."

      "title": "Rival Military Empires & External Patrons",
      "description": "The war is a breakdown of the **military elite order**. The **SAF**, backed primarily by **Egypt**, represents the old guard; the **RSF**, backed primarily by the **UAE**, is an informal **military-economic actor** (gold, illicit trade). Both compete over the **spoils of Sudan**, using **external arms and funding** to fuel their war.\n\nThe 2021 **military coup** was a **counter-revolution** against dismantling the **military's economic empire**. The **Egypt-UAE proxy rivalry**, playing out through their respective clients (SAF/RSF), is central to the conflict's intractability."

This echoes the **genocide** perpetrated by the Bashir regime (using the *Janjaweed*, precursors to the RSF) from 2003 onwards, rooted in the **colonial legacy** of marginalisation and state-sponsored racism."

UN panels, rights groups, and the **ICC** have recorded extensive violations, including **ethnic cleansing** in Darfur and **famine as a weapon of war**. Enforcing **accountability** is severely challenged by **obstructed access**, **external proxies** (UAE, Egypt), and **great power politics** at the **UN Security Council**. The **selective application** of international law allows **external actors** to support warring factions with **impunity**. Dismantling **economic networks** enabling **conflict profiteering** remains central to achieving justice."
