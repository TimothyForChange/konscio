  "currentCrisisSummary": "Sudan is engulfed in a brutal civil war between two **predatory military factions** (SAF & RSF), unleashing the world's largest **displacement crisis** and **mass famine**. The conflict has triggered widespread atrocities and renewed **ethnic cleansing in Darfur**, a region historically marginalised since the **colonial era**.\n\nThe warring elites compete for control of **economic spoils** (gold, land, **external patronage**), inflicting a catastrophic humanitarian collapse. Acute hunger affects millions, health systems collapse, and aid is deliberately obstructed. This war is actively sustained by **external actors** (like the UAE), transnational **arms flows**, and the failure of international systems to enforce **accountability**.",

    "legacy": "**British colonial governance** used **divide-and-rule**, concentrating power in the north while **marginalising peripheries** like Darfur. This **structural inequality** institutionalised grievance and set groundwork for rebellions.\n\nPrivileging the centre created a centralised, **extractive state** whose control over resources became the prize of military competition post-independence."

Under pressure from **US sanctions** and the **IMF**, his regime **privatised** assets, slashed subsidies, and encouraged '**land grabs**' by **foreign investors**. This policy of **austerity** and **resource extraction** enriched elites while impoverishing the population. The 2019 revolution was triggered by bread prices, a result of these **neoliberal policies**. The subsequent transitional government was pressured into '**shock therapy**', whose painful consequences contributed to the 2021 **military coup**."

Both compete over the **spoils of Sudan**. This reflects long patterns of **economic control**, **milia patronage**, and **resource extraction**, often involving **foreign capital** and **external actors**.\n\nThe 2021 **military coup** was a **counter-revolution** against dismantling the **military's economic empire**. The **RSF** is backed by states like the **UAE**, seeking influence and resources. Reports allege **external complicity** via arms supplies."
