  "currentCrisisSummary": "Sudan is engulfed in a brutal civil war between two factions of the military elite — the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia — which has unleashed the world's largest displacement crisis and one of the worst hunger emergencies in modern memory.\n\nThe conflict has triggered mass famine, widespread atrocities and a renewed campaign of ethnic cleansing, notably in Darfur. El Fasher and other Darfuri cities are under siege and cut off from aid. The warring factions compete not only for territory but for control of economic rails like gold, land, agriculture and external patronage. The resulting humanitarian collapse has overwhelmed Sudan;s people and the region.\n\nInternational humanitarian agencies warn that the crisis is worsening: more than half the population faces acute food insecurity, health systems are collapsing, and safe access to civilians is increasingly obstructed by the siege tactics and airstrikes used by both sides. The war is not isolated — it is sustained by external actors, transnational flows of arms and resources, and weak enforcement of international norms.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial governance in Sudan employed a classic divide-and-rule strategy, concentrating power in the 'Arab' riverine north while marginalising peripheral regions like Darfur and Kordofan. This structural inequality institutionalised regional grievance and set the groundwork for recurring rebellions and civil wars.\n\nBy privileging the centre and denying development to the margins, colonial rule created a centralised, extractive state whose control over resources and institutions became the prize of military competition post-independence."

  "historicalContext": {
    "rivalMilitaryEconomicModels": "The current war is a breakdown of an entrenched military elite order. The SAF represents the old guard's hold on formal sectors (bureaucracy, security, agriculture), whereas the RSF acts as a more entrepreneurial, informal military-economic actor controlling gold, illicit trade routes and private paramilitary roles. Both compete over the spoils of Sudan — land, mining, agriculture, and foreign leasing arrangements.\n\nThis struggle is not new: economic control, militia patronage and resource extraction have long been central to Sudanese elite survival, with successive regimes co-opted by foreign capital and external actors seeking influence.\n\nThe 2021 military coup was a counter-revolution against popular pressure to dismantle the military's economic empire. The RSF is backed by regional states, notably the UAE, which is accused of providing arms, financial support and logistical backing. These external actors seek influence, access to Sudanese gold, agricultural land and control of strategic Red Sea ports.\n\nRecent investigative reports document advanced weapons, drone systems and heavy artillery traced to external supply chains used by the RSF — raising credible allegations of external complicity in sustaining, and escalating, Sudan's war.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "Multiple international and regional legal processes are underway or proposed. Sudan has filed claims and complaints alleging external complicity in grave abuses. UN Security Council expert panels, human-rights organisations and the International Criminal Court are documenting war crimes, crimes against humanity and atrocity patterns committed by both SAF and RSF. The challenge is enforcing accountability in a conflict with shifting frontlines, obstructed access and powerful external proxies; protecting witnesses, securing evidence and dismantling economic networks that enable conflict profiteering are central to any credible justice effort."

    "displaced": "More than 11-12 million people are internally displaced, making Sudan the world's largest internal displacement crisis.",
    "refugees": "Over 4 million Sudanese have fled abroad since the conflict began.",
    "casualties": "Official statistics record approximately 19,000 killed and 33,000 injured, but these figures understate the true impact — independent estimates place tens of thousands dead due to direct combat and many more from starvation, disease and collapse of services.",
    "affected": "Over 30 million people — more than half the population — are estimated to require humanitarian assistance.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "It is estimated that up to 19 million children are out of school due to displacement, conflict damage to educational infrastructure, and insecurity.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "Large percentages of health facilities (especially in Darfur and conflict zones) are non-functional; targeted attacks on hospitals, shortages of staff and medicines, and siege conditions have broken down access to basic care. A hospital in El Fasher has been struck in attacks that caused many casualties.",
    "foodInsecurity": "Over 24 million people face acute food insecurity; in some areas (for example, camps under siege in Darfur) famine conditions have been reported.",
    "lackOfWaterAccess": "Access to water and sanitation has declined sharply; many urban and displacement areas lack safe drinking water. Cholera and other disease outbreaks have surged alongside the war.",
    "livingInPoverty": "The conflict has pushed millions into deeper poverty; regions once marginal are now destitute, with destruction of livelihoods, markets and infrastructure compounding collapse."
