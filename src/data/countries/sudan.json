  "currentCrisisSummary": "Sudan is engulfed in a brutal civil war between two **predatory military factions** (SAF & RSF), unleashing the **world's largest displacement crisis** and **mass famine**. The conflict has triggered widespread atrocities and renewed **ethnic cleansing in Darfur**, a region historically marginalised since the **colonial era**.\n\nThe warring elites compete for control of **economic spoils** (gold, land, external patronage), inflicting a **catastrophic humanitarian collapse**. International agencies warn of worsening conditions, with **acute hunger affecting millions**, collapsing health systems, and **deliberate obstruction of aid**. This war is not merely internal; it is **actively sustained by external actors (like the UAE)**, transnational arms flows, and the **failure of international systems** to enforce accountability or halt the violence.",

    "colonialPower": "Britain & Egypt (1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial governance in Sudan employed a classic divide-and-rule strategy, concentrating power in the 'Arab' riverine north while marginalising peripheral regions like Darfur and Kordofan. This structural inequality institutionalised regional grievance and set the groundwork for recurring rebellions and civil wars.\n\nBy privileging the centre and denying development to the margins, colonial rule created a centralised, extractive state whose control over resources and institutions became the prize of military competition post-independence."

      "title": "Neoliberalism and the Roots of Revolution",
      "description": "Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule, while Islamist and militaristic, also embraced a harsh neoliberal economic model. Under pressure from US sanctions and the IMF, his regime privatised state assets, slashed subsidies, and encouraged large-scale 'land grabs' by foreign investors, particularly from the Gulf. This policy of austerity and resource extraction enriched a small elite while impoverishing the population. The 2019 revolution was triggered by bread price hikes, a direct result of these long-standing neoliberal policies. Tragically, the subsequent transitional government was itself pressured by Western donors into a rapid 'shock therapy' program, whose painful economic consequences weakened its popular standing and contributed to the success of the 2021 military coup."

    {
      "title": "Rival Military Economic Models",
      "description": "The current war is a breakdown of an entrenched military elite order. The SAF represents the old guard's hold on formal sectors (bureaucracy, security, agriculture), whereas the RSF acts as a more entrepreneurial, informal military-economic actor controlling gold, illicit trade routes and private paramilitary roles. Both compete over the spoils of Sudan â€” land, mining, agriculture, and foreign leasing arrangements.\n\nThis struggle is not new: economic control, militia patronage and resource extraction have long been central to Sudanese elite survival, with successive regimes co-opted by foreign capital and external actors seeking influence.\n\nThe 2021 military coup was a counter-revolution against popular pressure to dismantle the military's economic empire. The RSF is backed by regional states, notably the UAE, which is accused of providing arms, financial support and logistical backing. These external actors seek influence, access to Sudanese gold, agricultural land and control of strategic Red Sea ports.\n\nRecent investigative reports document advanced weapons, drone systems and heavy artillery traced to external supply chains used by the RSF â€” raising credible allegations of external complicity in sustaining, and escalating, Sudan's war."

      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "Multiple international and regional legal processes are underway or proposed. Sudan has filed claims and complaints alleging external complicity in grave abuses. UN Security Council expert panels, human-rights organisations and the ICC are documenting war crimes, crimes against humanity and atrocity patterns committed by both SAF and RSF. The challenge is enforcing accountability in a conflict with shifting frontlines, obstructed access and powerful external proxies; protecting witnesses, securing evidence and dismantling economic networks that enable conflict profiteering are central to any credible justice effort."
