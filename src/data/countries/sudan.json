  "currentCrisisSummary": "A devastating civil war between two factions of a parasitic military eliteâ€”the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militiaâ€”has triggered the world's largest displacement and hunger crises, widespread famine, and atrocities, including a renewed campaign of ethnic cleansing in Darfur.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial policy was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that racialised and institutionalised ethnic divisions. It concentrated power in a supposedly 'Arab' riverine centre while systematically marginalising peripheral regions like Darfur. This engineered inequality created a parasitic central state that became the ultimate prize for competing factions of military and mercenary capitalists in the post-independence era."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "militaryVsMercenaryCapitalism": "The war is a violent conflict between two rival capitalist factions fighting to control the state. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) represents the old guard of 'military capitalism'â€”a crony system controlling formal sectors of the economy. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) represents a more agile, transnational 'mercenary capitalism', with wealth built on looting gold mines and operating as a private army for foreign powers. The war is the implosion of this parasitic system, as both factions now seek total control.",
    "counterRevolutionAndForeignPlunder": "The 2021 coup and subsequent war are a brutal counter-revolution against the 2019 popular uprising, which sought to dismantle the military's economic empire. This counter-revolution is bankrolled by foreign powers, particularly the UAE, which backs the RSF to secure its own interests: a direct supply of plundered gold, control over strategic Red Sea ports, and access to vast tracts of agricultural land for its own food security. This transforms the conflict into a proxy war for neocolonial plunder."

    "casualties": "The official death toll is approximately 19,000 killed and 33,000 injured [CSIS, July 2024], though credible estimates suggest the real figure is significantly higher due to inaccessible conflict zones.",
    "affected": "25 million peopleâ€”more than half the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian aid [UN OHCHR, 2024], with over 24 million facing acute food insecurity [IRC, 2025], making it the world's largest hunger crisis.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "More than 5 million children are out of school due to conflict, displacement, and destruction of educational infrastructure.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The health system has collapsed with only 30% of facilities functional, and 70% of medical staff have fled conflict areas.",
    "foodInsecurity": "Over 24 million people face acute food insecurity [IRC, 2025], with famine confirmed in Zamzam camp (North Darfur) since August 2024 [WFP, 2024] and over 635,000 people experiencing catastrophic famine conditions [IRC, 2025].",
