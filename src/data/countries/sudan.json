  "currentCrisisSummary": "A devastating civil war since April 2023 has triggered the world's largest displacement crisis, widespread famine, and atrocities, including ethnic cleansing in Darfur [Human Rights Watch, 2024].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial policy was built on divide-and-rule tactics [M.W. Daly, 2007]. It institutionalised ethnic and regional divisions by concentrating power and investment in the riverine centre while systematically underdeveloping and marginalising peripheral regions like the South and Darfur. This engineered inequality created a parasitic central state and blocked unified resistance. By pitting communities against each other, Britain established the structural basis for the centre-periphery conflicts and extractive politics that have defined Sudan's post-independence history of civil war."

  "coreTerms": {
    "proxyWarForResources": "The civil war is fuelled by regional powers, particularly the UAE [UN Panel of Experts on Sudan, 2024], competing for control of Sudan's resources and strategic location. Foreign backing for the warring factions transforms the internal power struggle into a proxy war for Sudan's gold, agricultural land, and Red Sea ports, prolonging the violence for geopolitical gain.",
    "inheritedStateViolence": "The war is an extension of the centre-periphery violence institutionalised during the colonial era. The state has historically used militias recruited from marginalised communities (like the RSF's precursors, the Janjaweed) to suppress dissent in other marginalised regions, a tactic that has now backfired, leading to the implosion of the central state itself."

    "casualties": "The official death toll of 15,000 is a significant underestimate; credible estimates suggest the real figure is over 150,000 [ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project), 2024; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine study, 2024].",
    "affected": "25 million peopleâ€”more than half the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian aid, with 18 million facing acute hunger [UN OCHA, 2024; Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, 2024]."
