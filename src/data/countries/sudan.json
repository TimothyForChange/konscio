  "currentCrisisSummary": "A civil war between two factions of the military eliteâ€”the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militiaâ€”has triggered the world's largest displacement and hunger crises, widespread famine, and atrocities, including a renewed campaign of reported ethnic cleansing in Darfur.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial policy was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that institutionalised ethnic divisions. It concentrated power in the 'Arab' riverine centre while marginalising peripheral regions like Darfur. This inequality created an extractive central state that became the prize for competing military factions in the post-independence era."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "rivalMilitaryEconomicModels": "The war is a conflict between two rival factions of a military-economic class fighting for control of the state. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) represents the traditional military's control over formal sectors of the economy. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) represents a more agile, transnational model, with wealth built on controlling gold mines and operating as a private military force for foreign powers. The war is the breakdown of this extractive system, as both factions now seek total control.",
    "politicalUpheavalAndForeignInterests": "The 2021 coup and subsequent war are a counter-revolution against the 2019 popular uprising, which sought to dismantle the military's economic empire. This counter-revolution is supported by foreign powers, particularly the UAE, which backs the RSF to secure its own interests: a supply of gold, influence over strategic Red Sea ports, and access to agricultural land. This transforms the internal conflict into a proxy war for regional influence and resources."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 11 million people internally displaced, making it the world's largest internal displacement crisis.",
    "refugees": "Over 2.7 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, including Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan.",
    "casualties": "The official death toll is approximately 19,000 killed and 33,000 injured, though credible estimates suggest the real figure is significantly higher due to inaccessible conflict zones.",
    "affected": "25 million peopleâ€”more than half the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian aid, with over 24 million facing acute food insecurity, making it the world's largest hunger crisis.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 19 million children are out of school due to the nationwide collapse of the education system.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The health system has collapsed, with 70-80% of health facilities in conflict-affected areas non-functional.",
    "foodInsecurity": "Over 24 million people face acute food insecurity, with famine confirmed in Zamzam camp (North Darfur) and over 635,000 people experiencing catastrophic famine conditions.",
    "lackOfWaterAccess": "Access to safe water has dropped by over 50% since the conflict began, affecting millions of people.",
    "livingInPoverty": "The conflict has pushed millions into poverty, with the national poverty rate estimated to have doubled since 2023."

  "timeline": [
    {
      "year": "1899-1956",
      "event": "**Anglo-Egyptian Condominium**: British colonial rule is established, implementing a divide-and-rule strategy that entrenches ethnic divisions."
    },
    {
      "year": "1956",
      "event": "**Independence**: Sudan gains independence from Britain. The new state retains the colonial structure that concentrates power and wealth in the 'Arab' riverine centre at the expense of marginalised peripheries like Darfur and the South, setting the stage for future civil wars."
    },
    {
      "year": "1989",
      "event": "**Bashir's Islamist Coup**: General Omar al-Bashir seizes power in a military coup backed by Islamists. His 30-year rule is defined by brutal counter-insurgency tactics, the empowerment of the military-security state, and the use of proxy militias to crush rebellions."
    },
    {
      "year": "2003",
      "event": "**Genocide in Darfur**: The government uses Janjaweed militias to crush a rebellion, leading to an indictment for genocide by the ICC. The RSF is the direct descendant of these militias."
    },
    {
      "year": "2019",
      "event": "**Sudanese Revolution**: A mass popular uprising, led by Resistance Committees, overthrows dictator Omar al-Bashir in a rejection of his rule and the economic austerity that impoverished the nation."
    },
    {
      "year": "2021",
      "event": "**Military Coup**: Generals al-Burhan (SAF) and 'Hemedti' (RSF) jointly seize power to protect their business empires from the democratic transition's planned reforms."
    },

      "year": "2023",
      "event": "**Civil War Erupts**: The alliance between the SAF and RSF breaks down into a violent struggle for absolute control of the state."
    }
  ],
  "environmentalImpact": {
    "conflictOverResources": "The war is linked to environmental factors through the struggle over natural resources. The RSF's economic model includes control and smuggling of gold from mines in Darfur and elsewhere. These unregulated mining operations have caused environmental degradation, including mercury pollution of water and soil, affecting local communities.",
    "climateChangeAndDesertification": "Sudan is highly vulnerable to climate change. Rapid desertification, a process linked to global warming, is destroying agricultural and pastoral land, particularly in Darfur and Kordofan. This loss of livelihoods intensifies competition over scarce water and land, which contributes to conflict dynamics."
  },
  "economicOverview": {
    "militaryControlledEconomy": "Sudan's economy has been dominated by military actors. The SAF controls significant business interests in the formal economy, including defence industries and agriculture. The RSF developed alternative revenue sources based on gold trade, security activities, and trade networks, with connections to regional partners. The current war represents a competition between these two economic models as they fight for control.",
    "economicAusterityAndProtests": "The 2019 protests were partly a response to the harsh economic austerity measures imposed by the Bashir regime to meet international financial requirements. The civilian government's attempts to reform the economic system and change the military's role in the economy were factors in the 2021 coup and the subsequent war."
  },
  "culturalHeritage": {
    "cradleOfCivilisations": "Sudan is home to an astonishingly rich ancient history, including the ruins of the Kingdom of Kush and the Nubian pyramids at MeroÃ«, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The country also has a deep tradition of Sufi Islam and a vibrant modern culture of music and poetry.",
    "heritageAtRisk": "The war poses a significant threat to this heritage. Fighting has damaged cultural institutions in the capital, Khartoum, including museums and archives. More broadly, the violence in Darfur affects the cultural identity of various communities, continuing patterns of conflict-related harm."
  },
  "geography": {
    "aStrategicCrossroads": "Sudan sits at a strategic crossroads connecting the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. Its long Red Sea coastline is a critical maritime corridor for global trade and of interest to various powers, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Turkey, all with interests in the region.",
    "aCentreAndPeriphery": "The country's geography has been politically defined by the colonial-era division between a wealthy, politically dominant riverine 'centre' around Khartoum and a vast, marginalized, and resource-rich 'periphery' that includes Darfur, Kordofan, and the Blue Nile. Sudan's entire post-colonial history has been shaped by conflicts between the centre and periphery over governance and resources."
  },
  "futureOutlook": {
    "stateFragmentation": "The war is causing significant challenges for state institutions. The humanitarian consequences are already severe, with the world's largest hunger and displacement crises. Without a resolution to the conflict, Sudan faces continued instability, food insecurity, and challenges in governance.",
    "ongoingPoliticalAspirations": "Despite the political changes since 2021, the aspirations from the 2019 revolution continue to influence political discourse. Various local networks continue to provide services and advocate for their vision of governance. The country's future will be shaped by how these different approaches to governance and society develop."
