  "currentCrisisSummary": "A devastating civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia since April 2023 has triggered the world's largest displacement and hunger crises, widespread famine, and atrocities, including a renewed campaign of ethnic cleansing in Darfur [Human Rights Watch, 2024].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "British colonial policy was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that racialised and institutionalised ethnic divisions [M.W. Daly, 2007]. It concentrated power and investment in a supposedly 'Arab' riverine centre while systematically underdeveloping and marginalising supposedly 'African' peripheral regions like Darfur and the South. This engineered inequality created a parasitic central state and blocked unified resistance. By pitting communities against each other, Britain established the structural basis for the centre-periphery conflicts that have defined Sudan's post-independence history."

  "coreTerms": {
    "proxyWarForResources": "The civil war is fuelled by regional and international powers, particularly the UAE and Russia's Wagner Group [UN Panel of Experts on Sudan, 2024], competing for control of Sudan's resources. Foreign backing for the warring factionsâ€”primarily the RSFâ€”transforms the internal power struggle into a proxy war for Sudan's gold, agricultural land, and Red Sea ports, prolonging the violence for geopolitical gain.",
    "inheritedStateViolence": "The war represents the implosion of the state's long-standing strategy of using proxy militias. The state has historically armed militias from marginalised communities (the Janjaweed) to suppress dissent in other marginalised regions. The RSF is the Frankenstein's monster of this policyâ€”a state-created militia that grew too powerful and has now turned on its creator, the Sudanese army, to seize the state for itself."

    "refugees": "More than 2 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, including Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan [UNHCR, 2024].",
    "casualties": "The official death toll of 15,000 is a gross underestimate; credible estimates suggest the real figure is over 150,000 [ACLED; Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, 2024].",
    "affected": "25 million peopleâ€”more than half the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian aid, with 18 million facing acute hunger in what has become the world's largest hunger crisis [UN OCHA; IPC, 2024]."
