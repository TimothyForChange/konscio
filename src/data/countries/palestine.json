  "currentCrisisSummary": "An intensifying humanitarian crisis across occupied Palestine, marked by mass displacement, engineered famine, and an International Court of Justice ruling on the plausibility of genocide in Gaza [ICJ, 26 January 2024]. This crisis is sustained by the unwavering geopolitical and military support of Western powers for the occupation.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in Britain's Mandate for Palestine (1920-1948). The Balfour Declaration (1917) promised a 'national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine, without the consent of the indigenous majority. British policy facilitated mass colonial settlement while suppressing Palestinian political rights. Britain's withdrawal in 1948 directly enabled the Nakba ('catastrophe'), during which over 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed to establish the state of Israel. This created a refugee crisis that continues to this day, making the ongoing Israeli occupation a direct continuation of this colonial legacy."

  "coreTerms": {
    "geopoliticalComplicity": "The occupation is sustained by Western powers, primarily the US and UK, which provide Israel with billions in unconditional military aid. This backing ensures Israel functions as a key strategic ally, projecting Western influence over Middle Eastern resources. It also serves the arms industry by providing a highly profitable, 'battle-tested' market for advanced weaponry.",
    "settlerColonialismAndApartheid": "The crisis is driven by an ongoing process of settler colonialism, marked by the illegal expansion of settlements and the systematic dispossession of Palestinians. Leading human rights organisations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem) now describe the system of Israeli control as apartheid. This system enables the expropriation of Palestinian land and water resources and the exploitation of a captive Palestinian labour market."

    "displaced": "Over 1.9 million internally displaced in Gaza (nearly 90% of the population) [UN OCHA, 2024], plus ongoing displacement in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.",

    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over 625,000 primary and secondary school children in Gaza have no access to education due to the complete destruction of the school system [Education Cluster/UNICEF, 2024].",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The healthcare system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled, with the majority of hospitals rendered non-functional and attacks on health facilities commonplace [WHO, 2025].",
