  "currentCrisisSummary": "An intensifying humanitarian crisis across occupied Palestine, marked by mass displacement, engineered famine, and an ICJ ruling on the plausibility of genocide in Gaza [International Court of Justice, 2024], a crisis that serves the strategic interests of Western imperialism in the region.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in Britain's Mandate (1920-1948). The Balfour Declaration (1917) promised their homeland to the Zionist movement without Palestinian consent [British Foreign Office, 1917]. British policy deliberately fostered conflict by promoting mass colonial settlement while suppressing Palestinian rights [Khalidi, 2006]. Britain's 1948 abdication directly enabled the Nakba ('catastrophe'), where over 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed to establish the state of Israel, creating a refugee crisis Britain refused to resolve [Morris, 2004]. The ongoing Israeli occupation is a direct continuation of this colonial legacy of dispossession."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "geopoliticalComplicity": "The conflict is sustained by Western powers, primarily the US and UK, which provide Israel with billions in unconditional military aid. This imperial backing is not ideological; it ensures Israel remains a strategic garrison for protecting Western control over Middle East resources and serves as a highly profitable, 'battle-testing' ground for the Western arms industry.",
    "settlerColonialismAndApartheid": "The crisis is a result of unresolved colonial injustices, including the right of return for refugees and the illegality of settlements. Leading human rights organisations now describe the system of Israeli control as apartheid [B'Tselem, 2021; HRW, 2021; Amnesty, 2022]. This system is also profitable, enabling the expropriation of Palestinian land and water resources and the exploitation of a captive labour market."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 1.9 million internally displaced in Gaza (nearly 85% of the population), plus ongoing displacement in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem [UN OCHA, 2024].",
    "refugees": "5.9 million registered Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), descendants of those displaced since 1948 [UNRWA, 2024].",
    "casualties": "Over 67,000 killed in Gaza since October 2023, with thousands more missing, presumed dead under the rubble [Gaza Ministry of Health, 2024] (verified by UN and international agencies).",
    "affected": "Gaza's entire population of 2.3 million faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including engineered famine and the systematic dismantling of its healthcare system [UN OCHA; IPC, 2024].",
    "hospitalsAffected": "More than 70% of Gaza's hospitals have been destroyed or severely damaged, with most no longer functional [WHO, 2024].",
    "schoolsAffected": "More than 200 schools have been destroyed and over 150 damaged, affecting the education of over 600,000 students [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over 600,000 children are out of school due to destruction of educational infrastructure and ongoing conflict [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The healthcare system in Gaza has completely collapsed with only 30% of essential services available [WHO, 2024].",
    "waterAccess": "95% of Gaza's water is undrinkable due to contamination from damaged infrastructure and conflict debris [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "foodInsecurity": "Over 1 million people in Gaza face catastrophic levels of hunger [WFP, 2024]."
