  "currentCrisisSummary": "Occupied Palestine, especially Gaza, endures an intensifying catastrophe inflicted by **Israeli settler colonialism** and **occupation**. This includes mass displacement, widespread civilian death, systematic destruction of public services, and crisis levels of **starvation and disease deliberately induced** through siege and bombardment.\n\nThe **ICJ** found claims of **genocide in Gaza plausible**; **accountability** efforts continue at the **ICC**. This extreme violence is enabled by unwavering **Western support** (especially US) and compounded by **internal Palestinian political fragmentation** and the **strategic abandonment** by key **Arab states** pursuing normalisation.",
  "imperialRoot": {
    "imperialPower": "Britain (1920-1948)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in policies enacted under the **British Mandate**. The 1917 **Balfour Declaration** endorsed a 'national home for the Jewish people' while promising to protect non-Jewish communities â€” a contradiction Britain didn't resolve.\n\nMandate policies facilitated **Zionist settlement** and undermined indigenous Arab rights. Britain's suppression of Palestinian movements and its 1948 withdrawal preceded the war and the ***Nakba***, during which 700k-750k Palestinians became refugees.\n\nThe refugee crisis, **dispossession**, and **Mandate precedents** inform today's structures of **occupation** and exclusion."

This **strategic alignment** reinforces the power imbalance.\n\n**Defence industries** benefit, and states gain a regional ally."

Human rights organisations find Israeli measures meet the threshold of **apartheid**.\n\nThis system is also economic/spatial: **land seizures**, **settler infrastructure**, **discriminatory resource allocation** create **structural dependency**."

      "title": "The Settlement Project and Two-Tier Legal System",
      "description": "Since 1967, Israel has constructed over 280 **illegal settlements** and outposts in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, violating the **Fourth Geneva Convention**. This project is the primary engine of **land theft**, **resource expropriation**, and **territorial fragmentation**. It is enforced by a **two-tier legal system** amounting to **apartheid**: Israeli settlers live under Israeli civil law, while Palestinians live under military rule. This system is designed to service and protect settlers, enabling **state-sanctioned settler violence** and the systematic displacement of Palestinian communities."

      "title": "Internal Fragmentation: Fatah-Hamas Split",
      "description": "Palestinian political life is deeply fractured, primarily by the **split between Fatah** (dominant in the PA/West Bank) **and Hamas** (governing Gaza since 2007). This division, often exploited by Israel, prevents a unified strategy, weakens Palestinian agency, and has resulted in two separate, competing political authorities. The **Palestinian Authority (PA)** itself faces criticism for **authoritarianism, corruption,** and its **security coordination** with the Israeli occupation under the Oslo framework."

      "title": "Role of Arab States: Blockade & Normalisation",
      "description": "Key **Arab states** play a complex, often **complicit role**. **Egypt** has enforced the **Gaza blockade** alongside Israel since 2007, controlling the Rafah crossing. More broadly, the trend of **normalisation agreements (Abraham Accords)** between Israel and states like the **UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan** represents a **strategic abandonment** of the Palestinian cause, prioritising economic and security ties with Israel/US over Palestinian rights."

The 1994 **Paris Protocol** locked the Palestinian economy into **dependency** on Israel. This '**economic peace**' created the **Palestinian Authority (PA)**, reliant on foreign aid, whose security forces often coordinate with the **occupation**, while **settlement expansion** accelerated."

      "title": "International Law and Accountability",
      "description": "Post-Oct 2023, legal processes were activated following overwhelming evidence of violations of the **Genocide Convention**. The **ICJ** found **plausible genocide** allegations and ordered **provisional measures**. The **ICC** investigates **war crimes**, though its jurisdiction faces political challenges. Despite these mechanisms, **enforcement** remains limited due to **US/Israeli** **veto power** at the **UN Security Council**. The **International Court of Justice** ruling represents a critical legal precedent but lacks enforcement mechanisms. **Universal jurisdiction** cases in various countries offer potential alternatives. Western **arms suppliers** continue to provide materials used in violations with **impunity**, highlighting the **selective application** of international law by powerful states. **Accountability** is further hindered by the **asymmetry** in international legal processes that allow Israeli officials to travel freely while Palestinian rights remain unenforced."
