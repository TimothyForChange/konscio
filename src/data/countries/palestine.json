  "currentCrisisSummary": "Occupied Palestine, especially Gaza, endures an intensifying catastrophe inflicted by **Israeli settler colonialism** and **occupation**. This includes mass displacement, widespread civilian death, systematic destruction of public services, and crisis levels of **starvation and disease deliberately induced** through siege and bombardment.\n\nThe **ICJ** found claims of **genocide in Gaza plausible**; **accountability** efforts continue at the **ICC**. This extreme violence and **structural deprivation** are enabled by unwavering military, economic, and diplomatic support from **Western powers**, particularly the US, shielding Israel from consequences.\n\nThese dynamics represent the current phase of a century-long process of **settler colonialism**, **ethnic cleansing** (*Nakba*), and **apartheid** designed to dispossess Palestinians and deny self-determination.",

The 1917 **Balfour Declaration** endorsed a 'national home for the Jewish people' while promising to protect non-Jewish communities â€” a contradiction Britain didn't resolve.\n\nMandate policies facilitated **Zionist settlement** and undermined indigenous Arab rights. Britain's suppression of Palestinian movements and its 1948 withdrawal preceded the war and the ***Nakba***, during which 700k-750k Palestinians became refugees.\n\nThe refugee crisis, **dispossession**, and **Mandate precedents** inform today's structures of **occupation** and exclusion."
