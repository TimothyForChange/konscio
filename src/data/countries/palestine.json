    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in Britain's Mandate (1920-1948). The Balfour Declaration (1917), issued without Palestinian consent, promised their homeland to the Zionist movement [British Foreign Office declaration, 2 November 1917]. British policy deliberately fostered conflict by promoting mass colonial settlement while suppressing Palestinian rights and national aspirations [Khalidi, 'The Iron Cage', 2006; Pappe, 'Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict', 1988]. By 1948, Britain abandoned its Mandate, leaving a manufactured crisis for the UN to handle [Mandate terminated 14 May 1948]. This abdication directly enabled the 1948 Nakba ('catastrophe'), where over 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed to establish the state of Israel, creating a refugee crisis Britain refused to resolve [Morris, 'The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited', 2004; Masalha, 'Expulsion of the Palestinians', 1992]. The ongoing Israeli occupation is a direct continuation of this colonial legacy of dispossession."

    "geopoliticalComplicity": "The conflict is sustained by Western powers, primarily the United States and the United Kingdom, which provide Israel with billions in unconditional military aid and diplomatic cover at the UN. This imperial backing enables the ongoing occupation and undermines Palestinian self-determination.",
    "settlerColonialismAndApartheid": "The current crisis is a result of unresolved colonial injustices. Key issues include the right of return for Palestinian refugees, the illegality of settlements under international law, and the military occupation. Leading human rights organisations now describe the system of Israeli control as apartheid [B'Tselem, 2021; Human Rights Watch, 2021; Amnesty International, 2022]."
