  "currentCrisisSummary": "An intensifying humanitarian crisis across occupied Palestine, marked by mass displacement, conditions of famine, and an International Court of Justice ruling on the plausibility of genocide in Gaza [ICJ, 26 January 2024]. This crisis is sustained by the geopolitical, military, and economic support of Western powers, primarily the United States, for the occupation.",
  "imperialRoot": {
    "imperialPower": "British Empire (Mandate for Palestine, 1920-1948)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in the British Mandate. The Balfour Declaration (1917) promised a 'national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine, disregarding the rights and aspirations of the Arab majority. British policy facilitated mass Zionist immigration and settlement while suppressing Palestinian resistance, implementing a strategy that entrenched communal tensions. Britain's withdrawal in 1948 directly enabled the 1948 war and the subsequent Nakba ('catastrophe'), during which Zionist militias expelled over 750,000 Palestinians in the process of establishing the state of Israel. This created a refugee crisis that continues to this day, making the ongoing Israeli occupation a continuation of this legacy."

  "coreTerms": {
    "geopoliticalInvolvement": "The occupation is sustained by Western powers, primarily the US, UK, and Germany, which provide Israel with billions in military aid and diplomatic cover. This backing helps Israel function as a key strategic ally for Western interests in the Middle East. It also serves the arms industry by providing a 'battle-tested' market for advanced weaponry.",
    "settlerColonialismAndApartheid": "The crisis is driven by an ongoing process of settler colonialism, marked by the illegal expansion of settlements and the systematic dispossession of Palestinians. Leading human rights organisations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem) now describe the system of Israeli control as apartheid. This system is not just political but economic: it enables the expropriation of Palestinian land and water, exploits a captive Palestinian labour market, and actively prevents the development of a sovereign Palestinian economy, ensuring structural dependency."

    "displaced": "Over 1.9 million internally displaced in Gaza (nearly 90% of the population) [UN OCHA, 2024], plus ongoing displacement in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.",
    "refugees": "5.9 million registered Palestinian refugees, descendants of those displaced since 1948, rely on UNRWA for essential services [UNRWA, 2024].",
    "casualties": "An estimated 64,000 to 67,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, with thousands more missing, presumed dead under the rubble [LSHTM study, The Lancet, January 2025].",
    "affected": "Gaza's entire population of 2.3 million faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including engineered famine and the systematic dismantling of its healthcare system [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over 625,000 primary and secondary school children in Gaza have no access to education due to the complete destruction of the school system [Education Cluster/UNICEF, 2024].",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The healthcare system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled, with the majority of hospitals rendered non-functional and repeated attacks on health facilities commonplace [WHO, 2025].",
    "waterAccess": "The water and sanitation system has almost completely collapsed, leaving over 95% of Gaza's water contaminated and unfit for human consumption [WASH Cluster, 2024].",
