  "currentCrisisSummary": "The northern province of Cabo Delgado is the centre of a violent conflict over some of Africa's largest natural gas reserves. The insurgency, led by Ahlu Sunnah wa Jama'a (ASWJ), is rooted in local grievances against a ruling elite and its multinational corporate partners (e.g., TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil), who are accused of capturing the region's wealth while displacing communities. The conflict is characterised by extreme brutality, and the intervention of foreign troops has been criticised for prioritising the security of corporate assets over the protection of civilians.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Portugal",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a legacy of 500 years of Portuguese colonial exploitation, based on forced labour and resource extraction. At independence in 1975, following a liberation war led by FRELIMO, departing Portuguese settlers deliberately damaged key infrastructure. This vulnerability was later exploited during the post-civil war era, when the IMF and World Bank imposed structural adjustment programs. These neoliberal reforms compelled FRELIMO to abandon its socialist project, opening the door for the foreign-led resource extraction seen today."

  "coreTerms": {
    "naturalGasConflictAndExternalInfluence": "The vast offshore gas fields are a modern 'resource curse', fuelling a conflict over resources that are marketed to the Global North as a 'transition fuel', despite the intense violence associated with their extraction. Critics argue that the political elite facilitates the dispossession of local communities on behalf of foreign corporations in exchange for a share of the profits. This arrangement mirrors the colonial model, where raw materials are funnelled out of the country, leaving local populations with the environmental damage and social collapse.",
    "destabilisationAndProxyWars": "Mozambique's post-independence history has been shaped by foreign-backed destabilisation. The devastating civil war (1977-1992) was a proxy war waged by the white-minority regimes in Rhodesia and Apartheid South Africa to undermine the FRELIMO government. This legacy of external interference is echoed in modern financial scandals, such as the 'hidden debts' crisis, where international banks like Credit Suisse worked with state officials to arrange billions in fraudulent loans [Chatham House, 2020]. This plunged the nation into debt, leading to austerity for the poor while enriching a small elite."
