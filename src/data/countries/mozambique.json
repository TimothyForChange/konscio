  "currentCrisisSummary": "The northern province of Cabo Delgado is the epicentre of a violent conflict over some of Africa's largest natural gas reserves. The insurgency, led by Ahlu Sunnah wa Jama'a (ASWJ), is rooted in local grievances against a ruling elite and its multinational corporate partners (e.g., TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil). In this arrangement, the state partners with foreign capital in ways that can lead to the dispossession of local citizens. The conflict is characterised by extreme violence, and the intervention of foreign troops has been criticised for prioritising the security of corporate assets over the protection of civilians.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Portugal (1505-1975)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a legacy of 500 years of Portuguese colonial rule. At independence in 1975, following a liberation war led by FRELIMO, departing Portuguese settlers damaged key infrastructure. This vulnerability was a factor when the IMF and World Bank later introduced structural adjustment programmes. These reforms used debt as leverage to encourage FRELIMO to move away from its socialist project, opening the economy to the foreign-led resource extraction seen today."

  "coreTerms": {
    "naturalGasConflictAndExternalInfluence": "The vast offshore gas fields are a modern 'resource curse', fuelling a conflict over resources marketed to the Global North as a 'transition fuel', despite the violence associated with their extraction. The political elite has been accused of facilitating the dispossession of local communities on behalf of foreign corporations in exchange for a share of the profits. This arrangement is similar to historical colonial models, where raw materials are extracted from the country, leaving local populations with environmental damage and social disruption.",
    "destabilisationAndForeignInterference": "Mozambique's post-independence history has been shaped by foreign-backed instability. The devastating civil war (1977-1992) was a proxy war supported by the minority-led regimes in Rhodesia and Apartheid South Africa to undermine the FRELIMO government. This legacy of external interference is echoed in modern financial issues, such as the 'hidden debts' crisis. In this scandal, international banks like Credit Suisse worked with state officials to arrange billions in loans under questionable circumstances [Chatham House, 2020], plunging the nation into debt and leading to austerity measures that impacted the poor while enriching a small elite."
