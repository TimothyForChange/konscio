  "currentCrisisSummary": "The northern province of Cabo Delgado is the centre of a violent conflict over some of the largest natural gas reserves in Africa. The insurgency, led by the group Ahlu Sunnah wa Jama'a (ASWJ), is rooted in local grievances against a state and multinational energy corporations (e.g., TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil) that have captured the region's wealth while displacing the local population. The conflict is characterised by extreme brutality, with the intervention of foreign troops (from Rwanda and the SADC) seen as protecting foreign corporate interests over Mozambican lives [ACLED, 2024].",

    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of nearly 500 years of Portuguese colonial exploitation. Portugal's rule was based on forced labour ('chibalo' system), resource extraction, and a deliberate policy of underdevelopment. At independence in 1975, following a brutal liberation war led by FRELIMO, the Portuguese sabotaged the nation's infrastructure and left behind a state with virtually no skilled professionals [Allen Isaacman, 'Mozambique: From Colonialism to Revolution', 1983]. This created a chronically weak state, predisposed to internal conflict and neocolonial penetration, laying the groundwork for today's resource war in Cabo Delgado."

  "coreTerms": {
    "bloodGasAndNeocolonialExtraction": "The vast offshore gas fields are a modern 'resource curse', fuelling a conflict over 'blood gas'. The promise of national prosperity has proven to be a mirage for the people of Cabo Delgado, who have lost their land and fishing grounds to corporate projects. The insurgency is a direct response to this dispossession and the state's role as a facilitator for multinational corporations. This arrangement mirrors the colonial extractive model, where resources are violently secured and funnelled out of the country, leaving local communities with only the environmental and social costs.",
    "destabilisationAndProxyWars": "Mozambique's post-independence history is defined by foreign-backed destabilisation. The devastating Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) was a proxy war in which the socialist FRELIMO government was attacked by RENAMO, an insurgency created and sustained by the white-minority regimes of Rhodesia and Apartheid South Africa to punish Mozambique for supporting anti-colonial liberation movements [Joseph Hanlon, 'Beggar Your Neighbours', 1986]. This history of externally engineered conflict shattered the social fabric and entrenched a political culture of violence, the legacy of which continues to shape the state's militarised response in Cabo Delgado."
