  "currentCrisisSummary": "Mozambique confronts a violent **Islamist insurgency** (ASWJ/ISIS) in Cabo Delgado province, driven by the **'resource curse'** and **state neglect rooted in colonial underdevelopment**. The conflict is fuelled by grievances over **illicit economies (heroin, rubies)** and exclusion from the massive **natural gas reserves**, which attracted billions in **foreign investment** but brought no benefit locally.\n\nThis fuels rebellion the **corrupt, centralised state** cannot contain. The conflict is internationalised, involving regional troops and **private mercenaries** protecting **gas projects**. It exemplifies a crisis born from a **predatory economic model**: state collaboration with **multinational corporations** to **extract wealth**, treating citizens as obstacles and **structurally producing** violent uprising and suffering.",

    "colonialPower": "Portugal (c. 1505-1975)",
    "legacy": "**Portugal's colonial rule** was brutal and underdeveloped. The economy used **forced labour** (***chibalo***), land was expropriated for settlers, with no investment in locals. The **colonial state** was purely for **extraction**.\n\nAt independence, Mozambique was impoverished, scarred, lacking skilled administrators. The **war of liberation** entrenched a militarised culture. **Economic sabotage** during the settlers' **scorched-earth withdrawal** (1974-75) crippled the new state, causing near-total **economic collapse**."

This conflict is not just about **gas**; it is layered upon decades of elite state complicity in **illicit economies**, notably **heroin and ruby trafficking**, which created a predatory environment that the insurgency exploits."
