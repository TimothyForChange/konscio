  "currentCrisisSummary": "Mozambique confronts a violent insurgency in its northern Cabo Delgado province, a conflict directly driven by the **'resource curse'** and decades of **state neglect rooted in colonial underdevelopment**. The discovery of massive **natural gas reserves** attracted billions in **foreign investment** but brought no benefit to the local population, instead fuelling **displacement, dispossession, and deep-seated grievances**.\n\nThis fertile ground for rebellion is exploited by an insurgency the **corrupt, centralised state** cannot contain. The conflict is internationalised, involving regional troops and **private mercenaries** hired to protect **multi-billion dollar gas projects**. It exemplifies a crisis born from a **predatory economic model**: state collaboration with **multinational corporations** to **extract wealth**, treating citizens as obstacles and **structurally producing the conditions for violent uprising and widespread suffering**.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Portugal (c. 1505-1975)",
    "legacy": "**Portugal's colonial rule** in Mozambique was one of the most brutal and underdeveloped in Africa. The economy was built on **forced labour** (**chibalo**) for plantations and mines, land was expropriated for **Portuguese settlers**, and there was virtually no investment in education or healthcare for the African majority. The **colonial state** was purely an instrument of **extraction** and violent control.\n\nThis legacy meant that at independence, Mozambique was left impoverished, with no skilled administrators, and deeply scarred. The long **war of liberation** against Portugal entrenched a militarised political culture. This was compounded by **economic sabotage** during the settlers' **scorched-earth withdrawal** (1974-1975): taking capital, destroying machinery, slaughtering livestock. This campaign crippled the new state, ensuring independence began in near-total **economic collapse**."

These regimes created and directed the **RENAMO insurgency**, plunging Mozambique into a devastating 16-year **civil war**. This was a deliberate, **externally-driven campaign of destabilisation** to destroy an alternative, anti-racist political project, shattering infrastructure and causing immense suffering."

The '**$2 Billion Hidden Debts**' scandal exemplifies this: state elites and **international banks** (Credit Suisse) colluded in **massive loan fraud**, largely embezzled. This **grand corruption** crippled the budget, deepened **dependency**, and confirmed the state exists primarily to enrich elites and their **foreign partners**."

In Cabo Delgado, serious human rights abuses by insurgents, state forces, and **foreign private military contractors** are reported. Lack of effective investigation mechanisms creates a cycle of **impunity**."
