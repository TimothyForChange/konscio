  "currentCrisisSummary": "A nationwide pro-democracy revolution against the 2021 military coupâ€”an act designed to protect the military's vast economic empire from democratic reformâ€”has escalated into a full-scale civil war. The junta is losing control over the country, triggering a humanitarian catastrophe and state collapse.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British rule was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that profoundly altered pre-colonial societal structures. The British created and racialised ethnic categories, administering the Bamar heartland separately from the 'Frontier Areas' of ethnic minorities. They strategically employed minorities like the Karen, Kachin, and Chin in the colonial army to suppress the Bamar majority, a policy which fostered deep inter-ethnic resentment. By institutionalising these ethnic hierarchies, Britain left a legacy of a fractured state, laying the groundwork for the world's longest-running civil wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "militaryCapitalismAndCorporateComplicity": "The Tatmadaw functions as both a military and a vast economic enterprise. Through its two conglomerates, MEHL and MEC, it controls huge swathes of the economy, from banking to mining, enriching a small class of generals. The 2021 coup is widely seen as a move to protect this business empire from democratic oversight. This system of military capitalism is sustained by revenue from international corporations, particularly in the extractive sector (oil, gas, gems), whose partnerships provide a crucial source of funds that enables the junta's human rights abuses.",
    "militaryRuleAsInternalColonialism": "The Tatmadaw's rule over ethnic minority regions functions as a form of internal colonialism. It uses extreme violence to control these peripheries, allowing its conglomerates and international partners to exploit their natural resources (jade, timber, gas). The Rohingya genocide is the most extreme manifestation of this system, which relies on colonial-era ethnic classifications to justify exclusion and persecution. A UN fact-finding mission found that the military's actions displayed 'genocidal intent'."
