  "currentCrisisSummary": "Myanmar suffers multiple, overlapping catastrophes inflicted by its **military state**: a nationwide civil war against the junta that seized power in 2021, and the **ongoing genocide and persecution of the Rohingya minority**. The post-coup conflict pits a broad revolutionary movement against the Tatmadaw (military), which employs **extreme brutality against civilians** nationwide.\n\nThis widespread violence follows the **2017 genocidal campaign against the Rohingya**, involving mass killings, systematic rape, and the forced expulsion of nearly a million people to Bangladesh, where they remain stateless refugees. The state's long history of **denying Rohingya citizenship**, a direct result of **colonial-era 'divide and rule' tactics** and post-colonial nationalism, laid the groundwork for this ethnic cleansing. The post-coup war and the Rohingya crisis create mass displacement and **severe, multi-faceted human suffering**, exacerbated by **geopolitical indifference and impunity** for the military regime.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British colonial policy created the fissures that define Myanmar's modern conflicts. Through 'divide and rule', Britain administered the Bamar lowlands separately from ethnic 'Frontier Areas', institutionalised ethnic identities, and used minorities in the colonial army, deepening divisions. Crucially, the British encouraged labour migration from Bengal into Arakan (Rakhine), including many Rohingya. After independence, the new state's nationalist project framed the Rohingya as 'illegal Bengali migrants', weaponising colonial-era resentments and British administrative legacies to deny their identity and ultimately render them stateless. This colonial architecture of ethnic hierarchy and division was inherited and ruthlessly exploited by the post-colonial military."

    {
      "title": "The Military as a State Within a State",
      "description": "For over 60 years, the Tatmadaw has operated as a state within a state, functioning as a privileged political and economic class. Through massive military-owned conglomerates (MEHL and MEC), it controls vast swathes of the economy. The 2021 coup was a violent move to protect this entrenched economic empire from democratic oversight."
    },
    {
      "title": "State-Sponsored Persecution and Rohingya Statelessness",
      "description": "The post-colonial state institutionalised discrimination against the Rohingya, culminating in the 1982 Citizenship Law, designed to legally erase their existence by refusing to recognise them as an official ethnic group. This act of legal violence rendered them stateless in their homeland, stripped them of all fundamental rights, and formalised their status as a people to be persecuted with impunity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Violence Against the Rohingya",
      "description": "Decades of discrimination erupted into systematic, state-directed violence, particularly in 2012 and 2017. The 2017 military 'clearance operations' were a premeditated campaign of mass killing, gang rape, and village destruction, terrorising the Rohingya into fleeing en masse. This violent expulsion, driving over 750,000 to Bangladesh, is now the subject of a genocide case at the ICJ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Khaki Capitalism and the Failed Transition",
      "description": "The decade of quasi-civilian rule (c. 2011-2021) was a period of military-managed neoliberal reform ('khaki capitalism'). Foreign investment often partnered with military conglomerates, modernising their empire under a civilian facade. The NLD government failed to challenge the military's power or its repressive, Bamar-centric state, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi defending the military's genocide against the Rohingya at the ICJ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Post-Coup Revolution and Ethnic Solidarity",
      "description": "The 2021 coup ignited a nationwide revolution, forging fragile solidarity between the Bamar majority and many long-oppressed ethnic minorities. The shared experience of the Tatmadaw's brutality has forced many Bamar democrats to confront the military's history of atrocities against ethnic peoples, including the Rohingya, creating potential for a new, federalist vision."
    },
    {
      "title": "Geopolitical Indifference and Impunity",
      "description": "Myanmar's military regime has been shielded from accountability. China and Russia use their UN Security Council vetoes to block strong action, protecting strategic investments. Western sanctions have lacked sufficient pressure, and ASEAN's non-confrontation policy has effectively normalised the military's crimes, including the Rohingya genocide."
    },
    {
      "title": "International Law and Accountability",
      "description": "Formal accountability efforts are underway but face political obstacles. The Gambia's ICJ case accuses Myanmar of violating the Genocide Convention concerning the Rohingya. The ICC is investigating potential war crimes and crimes against humanity related to both the Rohingya and post-coup violence. These processes are vital for challenging state impunity."
