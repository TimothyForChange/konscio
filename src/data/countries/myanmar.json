  "currentCrisisSummary": "A nationwide pro-democracy movement against the 2021 military coup has escalated into a wide-ranging civil war, producing one of the region's most severe humanitarian catastrophes.\n\nThe conflict is multi-front and multi-ethnic: anti-coup resistance groups, ethnic armed organisations and local defence forces contest territory with the Tatmadaw (the military), which has responded with scorched-earth tactics, sieges, air strikes and mass arrests. The violence compounds the aftermath of the 2017 campaign against the Rohingya, which generated a major refugee emergency in Bangladesh and prompted international legal action.\n\nHumanitarian indicators are stark: more than 3.5 million people are internally displaced across Myanmar, nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees remain in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh, and humanitarian needs in 2025 approach 19.9-21.9 million people. The junta's campaign has produced thousands of civilian deaths and widespread destruction of livelihoods, health and education systems. International accountability processes (including the ICJ case brought over the Rohingya) run alongside calls for arms embargoes, targeted sanctions and strengthened humanitarian access.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British colonial rule reorganised territory and identity through a 'divide and rule' approach that separated the Bamar heartland from the so-called 'Frontier Areas' inhabited by ethnic minorities. The colonial state institutionalised ethnic categories, employed minorities (Karen, Kachin, Chin) in colonial security forces, and allocated resources in ways that entrenched regional inequalities.\n\nThis administrative and political architecture left a fractured post-colonial state in which peripheral regions were treated as resource frontiers â€” a structural condition later reproduced by military rule and extractive corporate projects."
  },
  "historicalContext": {
    "militaryEconomyAndCorporateInvolvement": "The Tatmadaw operates as a political-economic complex: military conglomerates, control of natural-resource revenues and state capture generate revenue streams that insulate senior officers from civilian oversight. Military economic interests are central to why the junta resists reform and violent challenges.\n\nFor decades some international corporations, particularly in extractive sectors, have engaged with or profited from arrangements that bolstered military finances. Ending this dependence is a central demand of pro-democracy and rights groups.",
    "militaryRuleAndEthnicMinorities": "The Tatmadaw's long rule over ethnic minority regions resembles an internal colonial dynamic: resource extraction, forced labour, population displacement and military governance that curtail local autonomy. The 2017 clearance operations in Rakhine State â€” which UN investigators have found displayed genocidal intent towards the Rohingya â€” are a profound illustration of how ethnic hierarchies can be mobilised to justify dispossession and mass violence.\n\nThese dynamics have produced protracted refugee flows, communal polarisation and repeated cycles of armed insurgency.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "International legal and accountability processes are active but contested. The Gambia's ICJ case alleging violations of the Genocide Convention and subsequent ICJ orders concern the 2017 abuses against the Rohingya. Human-rights organisations, the UN and regional actors continue to document atrocity crimes, call for targeted sanctions, push for an arms embargo and press for criminal accountability through international mechanisms. These processes matter politically and legally even as enforcement remains difficult."
