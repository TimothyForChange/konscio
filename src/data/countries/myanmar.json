  "currentCrisisSummary": "A nationwide pro-democracy revolution against the 2021 military coupâ€”an act designed to protect the military's vast economic empire from democratic reformâ€”has escalated into a full-scale civil war. The junta is losing control over the country, triggering a humanitarian catastrophe and state collapse.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British rule was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that shattered pre-colonial societal structures [Thant Myint-U, 'The River of Lost Footsteps', 2006]. The British created and racialised ethnic categories, administering the Bamar heartland separately from the 'Frontier Areas' of ethnic minorities. They strategically used minorities like the Karen, Kachin, and Chin in the colonial army to suppress the Bamar majority, deliberately manufacturing inter-ethnic resentment. By institutionalising these ethnic hierarchies, Britain left a legacy of a fractured state, laying the groundwork for the world's longest-running civil wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "militaryCapitalismAndCorporateComplicity": "The Tatmadaw is not just an army; it is a criminal economic enterprise. Through its two conglomerates, MEHL and MEC, the military controls huge swathes of the economy, enriching a small class of generals. The 2021 coup was a move to protect this business empire. This system is sustained by international corporations, particularly in the extractive sector (oil, gas, gems), that have historically partnered with the military, providing a stream of revenue that directly funds the junta's atrocities.",
    "militaryRuleAsInternalColonialism": "The Tatmadaw's rule functions as a form of internal colonialism. It uses extreme violence to control ethnic peripheries and exploit their natural resources (jade, timber, gas) through its own conglomerates and international corporate partners. The Rohingya genocide is the most extreme manifestation of this system, which uses colonial-era ethnic classifications to exclude and persecute. A UN mission found evidence of 'genocidal intent' in the military's actions [UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, 2018]."
