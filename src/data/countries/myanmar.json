    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British rule was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that shattered pre-colonial societal structures [Thant Myint-U, 'The River of Lost Footsteps', 2006]. The British created and racialised ethnic categories, administering the Bamar heartland separately from the 'Frontier Areas' of ethnic minorities. They strategically used minorities like the Karen, Kachin, and Chin in the colonial army to suppress the Bamar majority, deliberately manufacturing inter-ethnic resentment. By institutionalising these ethnic hierarchies, Britain left a legacy of a fractured state, laying the groundwork for the world's longest-running civil wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "ethnoNationalismAndFederalism": "The post-independence state, dominated by the Bamar military (Tatmadaw), has violently enforced a singular, Bamar-centric national identity. The struggle of ethnic resistance organisations for a federal democracy and self-determination is a direct challenge to this chauvinistic, centralised model of the state inherited from the colonial era.",
    "militaryRuleAsInternalColonialism": "The Tatmadaw's rule functions as a form of internal colonialism. It uses extreme violence to control ethnic peripheries and exploit their natural resources (jade, timber, gas) for the benefit of a central military elite. The Rohingya genocide is the most extreme manifestation of this system, which uses colonial-era ethnic classifications to exclude and persecute. A UN mission found evidence of 'genocidal intent' in the military's actions [UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, 2018]."
