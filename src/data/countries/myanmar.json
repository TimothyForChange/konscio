  "currentCrisisSummary": "A nationwide pro-democracy movement against the 2021 military coup has escalated into a full-scale civil war, triggering a humanitarian crisis. This multi-ethnic uprising seeks to challenge the system of military-led governance. The war unfolds alongside the ongoing effects of the 2017 crisis, which the UN has described as a genocide, and which has forced nearly one million survivors into sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh, creating a multi-faceted regional crisis.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British rule was built on a 'divide-and-rule' strategy that altered pre-colonial societal structures. The British formalised ethnic categories, administering the Bamar heartland separately from the 'Frontier Areas' of ethnic minorities. They employed minorities like the Karen, Kachin, and Chin in the colonial army to suppress the Bamar majority, a policy which fostered inter-ethnic resentment. By institutionalising these ethnic hierarchies, Britain left a legacy of a divided state, which contributed to the country's long-running civil wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "militaryEconomyAndCorporateInvolvement": "The Tatmadaw (Myanmar's armed forces) functions as both a military and a major economic enterprise. Through its conglomerates, it controls large parts of the economy, enriching a small class of generals. This system, where ethnic states are treated as resource-rich territories for exploitation, has parallels with the British colonial economic model. For decades, some international corporations, particularly in the oil and gas sector (e.g., TotalEnergies, Chevron), have been involved in this system, providing the military government with a key source of revenue.",
    "militaryRuleAndEthnicMinorities": "The Tatmadaw's rule over ethnic minority regions has been described as a form of internal colonialism. It uses violence to control these peripheral areas and exploit their natural resources (timber, jade, gas). The 2017 Rohingya crisis is the most extreme manifestation of this system, which uses ethnic hierarchies established during British rule to justify exclusion, dispossession, and persecution. A UN fact-finding mission found that the military's actions displayed 'genocidal intent'."

    "affected": "18.6 million peopleâ€”one-third of the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian aid as the economy and healthcare system collapse.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over 1.5 million children have had their education disrupted due to conflict and military occupation of schools.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The public healthcare system has collapsed due to systematic military attacks and health workers joining the pro-democracy Civil Disobedience Movement."
