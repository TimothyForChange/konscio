  "currentCrisisSummary": "Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping humanitarian crises. In the North-East, the Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgencies have created one of Africa's most severe displacement and food crises [UN OCHA]. The North-West is terrorised by armed bandit groups engaged in mass kidnapping and plunder. Across the country, particularly in the Middle Belt, escalating conflict between herders and farmers, driven by climate change and resource scarcity, deepens the instability. These crises are symptoms of a fractured state struggling with the violent legacies of its colonial creation.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain",
    "legacy": "Nigeria's crisis is rooted in its forced creation by Britain. The 1914 amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates welded over 250 distinct ethnic nationalities into a single entity without consent. Britain's 'divide and rule' policy institutionalised a political imbalance between the predominantly Muslim North and Christian South, creating permanent fault lines for ethno-religious conflict [Walter Rodney, 'How Europe Underdeveloped Africa']. The colonial economy was purely extractive, building infrastructure only to export resources like palm oil and tin, leaving behind a state structure designed not for governance but for efficient plunder by a small elite."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theNationalQuestion": "This refers to the unresolved contradictions baked into the Nigerian state by its colonial architects. The fundamental issue is whether the disparate peoples forcibly amalgamated by Britain can ever form a unified nation. It manifests in a constant struggle for power and resources between ethnic and religious groups, fuelling everything from the Biafran War (1967-70) to contemporary secessionist movements and violent political competition. The state's legitimacy is perpetually in question because its very foundation is colonial and illegitimate.",
    "theOilCurseAndNeocolonialExtraction": "Nigeria is a textbook case of the 'resource curse', a direct continuation of the colonial extractive model. The discovery of oil created a neocolonial system where vast wealth is siphoned out of the Niger Delta by multinational corporations (like Shell, Eni, and Chevron) in partnership with a deeply corrupt Nigerian ruling class [Amnesty International]. This has led to catastrophic environmental degradation, the violent suppression of local communities demanding justice, and a political economy where control of the state is a zero-sum battle for oil revenues, fuelling nationwide instability."

    "displaced": "Over 3 million people are internally displaced by conflict, the vast majority in the North-East [UN OCHA, 2024].",
    "refugees": "More than 340,000 Nigerian refugees have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger [UNHCR, 2024].",
    "casualties": "The conflict in the North-East alone has directly and indirectly caused over 350,000 deaths since 2009, with half being children under five [UNDP, 2021]. Thousands more have been killed by bandits and in farmer-herder clashes.",
    "affected": "In the North-East, 7.9 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance, with millions facing crisis levels of hunger and malnutrition [UN OCHA, 2024]."
