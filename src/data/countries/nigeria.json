  "currentCrisisSummary": "Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping humanitarian crises. In the North-East, the Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgencies have created one of Africa's most severe displacement crises. The North-West is terrorised by armed bandit groups engaged in mass kidnapping, while escalating conflict between herders and farmers deepens instability nationwide. These crises are symptoms of a fractured state, weakened by decades of neoliberal economic policies and struggling with the violent legacies of its colonial creation.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain",
    "legacy": "Nigeria's instability is rooted in its forced creation by Britain. The 1914 amalgamation merged over 250 distinct ethnic nationalities into a single entity without their consent, while 'divide and rule' policies institutionalised a political imbalance that created lasting fault lines for conflict. The colonial economy was primarily extractive, leaving behind a state apparatus designed for resource exploitation rather than public welfare. This model was later intensified by the discovery of oil and entrenched by neoliberal reforms."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theNationalQuestion": "This refers to the unresolved contradictions inherent in the Nigerian state's colonial formation. The fundamental issue is whether the disparate peoples forcibly amalgamated by Britain can form a cohesive nation. Because control of the state's oil-funded apparatus is the primary route to wealth, political competition often becomes a violent, zero-sum contest. The state's legitimacy is therefore perpetually challenged, as its very foundations are seen as artificial and imposed.",
    "theOilCurseAndNeocolonialExtraction": "Nigeria is a textbook case of the 'resource curse'. Vast oil wealth is extracted from the Niger Delta by multinational corporations (Shell, Eni, Chevron) in partnership with a domestic ruling class that facilitates this process. This system was entrenched by IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs in the 1980s. These policies dismantled Nigeria's domestic industries, deepened its dependency on oil exports, and imposed austerity measures that created mass poverty, fuelling the social breakdown seen today."
