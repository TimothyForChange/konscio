  "currentCrisisSummary": "Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping humanitarian challenges. In the North-East, the Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgencies have created one of Africa's most severe displacement crises. The North-West is destabilised by armed bandit groups engaged in mass kidnapping, while escalating conflict between herders and farmers deepens instability nationwide. These challenges are symptoms of a state struggling with governance, where securing oil extraction for foreign capital has often been a higher priority than providing security for its citizens. The state's weakness is a result of decades of certain economic policies and the legacies of its colonial creation.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain (various protectorates, 1885-1960)",
    "legacy": "Nigeria's instability is rooted in its creation by Britain. The 1914 amalgamation merged over 250 distinct ethnic nationalities into a single entity, while 'divide and rule' policies created a political imbalance that has been a source of conflict. The colonial economy was primarily extractive, leaving behind a state apparatus focused on resource exploitation rather than public welfare. This model was later intensified by the discovery of oil and reinforced by certain economic reforms."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theNationalQuestion": "This refers to the unresolved questions inherent in the Nigerian state's colonial formation. The fundamental issue is whether the disparate peoples amalgamated by Britain can form a cohesive nation. Because control of the state's oil-funded apparatus is the primary route to wealth, political competition often becomes a high-stakes, zero-sum contest. The state's legitimacy is therefore perpetually challenged, as its foundations are seen by some as artificial and imposed.",
    "theOilCurseAndForeignExtraction": "Nigeria is an example of the 'resource curse'. Vast oil wealth is extracted from the Niger Delta by multinational corporations (Shell, Eni, Chevron) in partnership with a domestic elite. This system was reinforced by IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programmes in the 1980s. These policies led to a dependency on oil exports, the decline of domestic industries, and austerity measures that contributed to mass poverty and social unrest."

    "refugees": "More than 340,000 Nigerian refugees have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger [UNHCR, 2025].",
    "casualties": "The conflict in the North-East alone has directly and indirectly caused an estimated 350,000 deaths since 2009, with half being children under five [UNDP, 2021]. Thousands more have been killed by bandits and in farmer-herder clashes.",
    "affected": "An estimated 7.9 million people in the North-East require urgent humanitarian assistance [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 2 million children in the North-East are out of school due to conflict and displacement [Education Cluster, 2024].",
