  "currentCrisisSummary": "Cuba faces a severe and protracted economic crisis, primarily driven by the six-decade-long **unilateral economic blockade** imposed by the United States. This regime of **sanctions** constitutes the longest act of **economic warfare** in modern history, deliberately strangling the island's economy.\n\nThe **blockade** restricts trade, finance, and imports (food, medicine, fuel). This **external coercion** causes chronic shortages, cripples public services, and fuels emigration. While internal challenges exist, they are inseparable from constraints imposed by the US embargo, which functions as **collective punishment** designed to force political change.",

    "legacy": "Cuba's history is marked by **colonial** and **imperial domination**. **Spanish rule** established a **plantation economy** (slavery, **resource extraction**). After Cuba's independence struggle, the **US intervened** (1898), transforming the island into a **neo-colony**.\n\nThe **Platt Amendment** (1901) enshrined the US right to intervene, and **US corporations** dominated the economy (sugar). This created a **dependent**, unequal society governed by **US-backed dictators** (Batista). The 1959 revolution rejected **US domination**, leading immediately to hostile US efforts and the **economic blockade**."

      "description": "Implemented in 1962, the **US blockade** is a web of restrictions suffocating the economy. It prohibits transactions, penalises third-country companies (**extraterritoriality**), blocks access to finance, and impedes imports. Intensified by laws like **Helms-Burton** (1996), the **blockade** explicitly aims to cause suffering to compel regime change, violating Cuban sovereignty and **international law**."
