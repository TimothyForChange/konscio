  "currentCrisisSummary": "Cuba faces a severe and protracted economic crisis, primarily driven by the six-decade-long unilateral economic blockade imposed by the United States. This comprehensive regime of sanctions constitutes the longest-lasting act of economic warfare in modern history, deliberately strangling the island's economy and inflicting immense hardship on its population.\n\nThe blockade severely restricts Cuba's ability to trade, access finance, import essential goods (including food, medicine, and fuel), and develop its economy. This external coercion has caused chronic shortages, crippled public services, and fuelled emigration. While internal economic challenges exist, they are inseparable from the profound structural constraints imposed by the US embargo, which functions as a form of collective punishment designed to force political change.",

    "legacy": "Cuba's history is marked by centuries of colonial and imperial domination. Spanish rule established a plantation economy based on slavery and resource extraction. Following Cuba's independence struggle against Spain, the US intervened in 1898, effectively transforming the island into a neo-colony.\n\nThe Platt Amendment (1901) enshrined the US right to intervene in Cuban affairs, and US corporations came to dominate the economy, particularly the sugar industry. This created a dependent, unequal society governed by US-backed dictators like Fulgencio Batista. The 1959 revolution was a direct rejection of this century of US domination, leading immediately to hostile US efforts to overthrow the new government and impose the economic blockade that continues to this day."

      "title": "The US Blockade: Economic Warfare",
      "description": "Implemented formally in 1962, the US blockade (often misleadingly called an 'embargo') is a vast web of financial and trade restrictions designed to suffocate the Cuban economy. It prohibits most transactions, penalises third-country companies trading with Cuba (extraterritoriality), blocks access to international financial institutions, and impedes the import of food, medicine, and technology. Intensified by laws like Helms-Burton (1996) and further tightened under recent administrations, the blockade is explicitly aimed at causing suffering to compel regime change, a clear violation of Cuban sovereignty and international law."
    },
    {
      "title": "Impact on Health and Food Security",
      "description": "The blockade has devastating consequences for public health and food security. Restrictions prevent Cuba from acquiring life-saving medicines, medical equipment, and technologies, even from third countries, leading to preventable suffering and death. Similarly, limitations on food imports and agricultural inputs severely impact food availability and affordability, contributing to nutritional challenges. These impacts constitute a clear violation of the human rights of the Cuban people."
    },
    {
      "title": "Post-Soviet 'Special Period' and Neoliberal Pressure",
      "description": "The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 plunged Cuba into a severe economic crisis known as the 'Special Period', as its primary trading partner disappeared. Instead of lifting the blockade to alleviate suffering, the US deliberately intensified it (Helms-Burton Act), aiming to deliver a final blow. This period highlighted Cuba's vulnerability, created by both its reliance on the Soviet bloc and the ongoing US economic warfare designed to prevent diversified development."
    },
    {
      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "The US blockade against Cuba is overwhelmingly condemned by the international community. Every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost unanimously to demand its end, citing violations of the UN Charter, international law, and the principle of sovereign equality. The blockade's extraterritorial nature (punishing third countries) is a particularly egregious breach of international norms. Despite this global consensus, the US maintains the blockade due to entrenched domestic political interests and its long-standing imperial objective of controlling Cuba."
