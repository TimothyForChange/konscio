  "currentCrisisSummary": "Cuba faces a severe and protracted crisis, driven by two co-equal factors: the six-decade-long **unilateral US economic blockade** and **catastrophic internal state mismanagement**.\n\nThe **blockade** is an act of **economic warfare** that deliberately strangles the island's economy, restricting food, medicine, and finance. This **external coercion** is compounded by a **one-party authoritarian state** whose own **disastrous 2021 monetary reform (*Tarea Ordenamiento*)** triggered **hyperinflation** and destroyed savings. This dual crisis of **external pressure** and **internal failure** fuels chronic shortages, state collapse, and mass emigration.",

    "legacy": "Cuba's history is defined by **imperial dependency**. **Spanish rule** established a **plantation economy**. The **US intervened** in 1898, transforming the island into a **neo-colony** governed by **US-backed dictators** (Batista).\n\nThe 1959 revolution rejected **US domination** but, to survive the subsequent **US blockade**, established a new dependency as a **client state of the Soviet Union**. The **Special Period** (1991) was the result of this **Soviet imperial patronage** collapsing. Cuba's modern crisis is defined by the legacy of these successive dependencies."

      "title": "The US Blockade: Economic Warfare",
      "description": "Implemented in 1962, the **US blockade** is a web of restrictions suffocating the economy. It prohibits transactions, penalises third-country companies (**extraterritoriality**), blocks access to finance, and impedes imports. Intensified by laws like **Helms-Burton** (1996), the **blockade** explicitly aims to cause suffering to compel regime change, violating Cuban sovereignty and **international law**."

    {
      "title": "Internal Mismanagement: The *Tarea Ordenamiento*",
      "description": "The 2021 ***Tarea Ordenamiento*** (monetary reform) was a **catastrophic internal shock** separate from the blockade. The state's ill-conceived unification of its dual-currency system **triggered runaway hyperinflation**, instantly vaporised the value of salaries and savings, and decimated production. This **state-engineered economic collapse** is a primary driver of the current humanitarian crisis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Authoritarianism and the 11J Protests",
      "description": "The crisis is also political. The state is a **one-party authoritarian system** that represses all dissent. The historic **July 11, 2021 (11J) protests**â€”the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1959â€”were a popular uprising against shortages and dictatorship. They were met with a **brutal state crackdown**, mass arrests, show trials, and long prison sentences, cementing **political repression** as a co-equal driver of mass emigration."

      "title": "Collapse of Soviet Dependency (**Special Period**)",
      "description": "The collapse of the **Soviet Union** (1991)â€”Cuba's **imperial patron**â€”caused a devastating crisis (**Special Period**). This revealed the economy's deep **structural dependency** on Soviet subsidies (sugar-for-oil). The US exploited this vulnerability by intensifying the **blockade** (**Helms-Burton Act**), aiming for total collapse."

      "description": "The **US blockade** is overwhelmingly condemned internationally (**UN General Assembly** votes). Its **extraterritorial** nature breaches international norms. The US maintains it due to domestic politics and its **imperial objective** of controlling Cuba."
