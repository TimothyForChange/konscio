  "currentCrisisSummary": "Cameroon endures multiple severe crises rooted in the violent legacies of its **colonial construction**. The most acute is the armed conflict in the Anglophone regions, where **state repression** against demands for political and cultural rights has escalated into a brutal war. In the Far North, a brutal insurgency by **Boko Haram** and **ISWAP**, spilling over from the **Lake Chad Basin**, is fuelled by deep **state neglect**.\n\nBoth crises are sustained by a **political economy of elite enrichment** and **foreign corporate extraction** (oil, timber), underwritten by geopolitical partners like **France** and **China**. This perpetuates suffering and displacement.",

    "colonialPower": "Germany (1884-1916), partitioned by France & Britain (1916-1961)",
    "legacy": "Cameroon's fractures were engineered by its **partition after WWI**. Germany's colony was divided between France and Britain, administered under different **colonial philosophies** (French **assimilation** vs. British **indirect rule**).\n\nAt independence, 'reunification' was an absorption of the Anglophone territory into the Francophone state. The promised federal structure was abolished. This **centralisation** imposed a foreign system, creating a dynamic of **internal colonialism** that led to war."

      "title": "Violent Decolonisation and Neo-Colonial Control",
      "description": "Independence was born in violence. France waged a brutal war against the **anti-colonial movement** (UPC), killing tens of thousands, then installed a compliant regime. This ensured French economic interests remained secure, establishing a durable **neo-colonial relationship** (*FranÃ§afrique*) defining the state's repressive character."

    {
      "title": "The Anglophone Problem and Forced Assimilation",
      "description": "The Anglophone crisis results from decades of **systematic marginalisation**. Abolishing federalism in 1972 initiated deliberate **assimilation**. Anglophone legal/educational systems were eroded, regions economically neglected. These policies aimed to break Anglophone identity and consolidate state power."

      "title": "The Lake Chad Basin Crisis (Boko Haram)",
      "description": "The Far North region suffers from a distinct crisis: the spillover of the **Boko Haram** and **ISWAP** insurgency from Nigeria. This war is not just a 'neglect' issue; it is a full-blown conflict in the ecologically-degraded **Lake Chad Basin**. The state's response has been heavily militarised but has failed to address the root causes of **systemic marginalisation** and **ecological collapse** that allow the insurgency to recruit."

      "title": "21st Century Geopolitics: China's Role",
      "description": "While **France** maintains its historic neo-colonial grip, **China** has emerged as the state's primary 21st-century economic partner. This relationship is built on **resource-backed loans** for infrastructure (e.g., Kribi port), massive **timber and mineral extraction**, and crucial **diplomatic protection**. China shields the regime from **UN Security Council** scrutiny, offering 'no-strings' support that **finances authoritarianism** and neutralises Western leverage."

      "title": "Neoliberal Austerity and Structural Adjustment",

These **neoliberal policies** enforced severe **austerity** (lay-offs, **privatisation**, cuts). **SAPs hollowed out the state**, worsened inequality, and devastated livelihoods, creating grievance forming the backdrop to the 2016 explosion."
