  "currentCrisisSummary": "Cameroon endures multiple severe crises rooted in the violent legacies of its **colonial construction**. The most acute is the armed conflict in the Anglophone regions, where **state repression** against demands for political and cultural rights has escalated into a brutal war. This conflict results directly from a hyper-centralised, authoritarian state modelâ€”inherited from **French colonial rule**â€”that has systematically dismantled Anglophone autonomy.\n\nIn the Far North, **state neglect** fuels insurgency. Both crises are sustained by a **political economy of elite enrichment** and **foreign corporate extraction** (oil, timber), perpetuating suffering and displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Germany (1884-1916), partitioned by France & Britain (1916-1961)",
    "legacy": "Cameroon's fractures were engineered by its **partition after WWI**. Germany's colony was divided between France and Britain, administered under different **colonial philosophies** (French **assimilation** vs. British **indirect rule**).\n\nAt independence, 'reunification' was an absorption of the Anglophone territory into the Francophone state. The promised federal structure was abolished. This **centralisation** imposed a foreign system, creating a dynamic of **internal colonialism** that led to war."

      "title": "Violent Decolonisation and Neo-Colonial Control",
      "description": "Independence was born in violence. France waged a brutal war against the **anti-colonial movement** (UPC), killing tens of thousands, then installed a compliant regime. This ensured French economic interests remained secure, establishing a durable **neo-colonial relationship** (*FranÃ§afrique*) defining the state's repressive character."

      "title": "The Anglophone Problem and Forced Assimilation",
      "description": "The Anglophone crisis results from decades of **systematic marginalisation**. Abolishing federalism in 1972 initiated deliberate **assimilation**. Anglophone legal/educational systems were eroded, regions economically neglected. These policies aimed to break Anglophone identity and consolidate state power."

      "title": "Neoliberal Austerity and Structural Adjustment",
      "description": "Following an economic crisis (late 1980s), Cameroon adopted **Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)** mandated by the **IMF** and **World Bank**. These **neoliberal policies** enforced severe **austerity** (lay-offs, **privatisation**, cuts). **SAPs hollowed out the state**, worsened inequality, and devastated livelihoods, creating grievance forming the backdrop to the 2016 explosion."

      "title": "Resource Extraction and Elite Enrichment",
      "description": "For decades, an elite used state power to control revenues from oil, timber, etc. This system, often facilitated by **foreign corporations**, entrenched **corruption**. The state manages **extractive contracts** rather than providing services. Underdevelopment results directly from a **political economy** concentrating wealth and marginalising the periphery."
