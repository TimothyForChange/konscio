  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a resource war fought over its vast mineral wealthâ€”cobalt, coltan, and goldâ€”that powers the global tech and 'green' energy industries. This exposes the brutal hypocrisy of a 'clean' transition in the Global North built on extreme violence in the Global South. The conflict involves the Congolese army, over 100 armed groups, and foreign-backed militias, notably Rwanda's M23 [UN Group of Experts on the DRC, 2023], creating one of the world's worst displacement crises and characterised by the systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Belgium (King Leopold II & the Belgian State)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of Belgium's exceptionally brutal colonial rule. King Leopold II's personal Congo Free State (1885-1908) was a slave state where millions were killed or mutilated to extract rubber and ivory for European capital [Adam Hochschild, 'King Leopold's Ghost', 1998]. The Belgian state continued this purely extractive model, intentionally building no viable local institutions. This colonial architecture, designed for efficient plunder, perfectly conditioned the nation for the neocolonial scramble for resources that benefits multinational corporations today."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "conflictMineralsAndProxyWars": "The DRC's wealth is a curse, fuelling a neocolonial war over 'blood minerals'. The entire system functions as a violent supply chain for global capitalism. Neighbouring states, particularly Rwanda and Uganda, arm proxy militias (like M23) to control the mines and traffic the resources [UN Group of Experts on the DRC, 2023]. At the top of this chain, multinational tech and automotive companies reap enormous profits from cheap, blood-soaked minerals, while professing ignorance of their origin.",
    "theHollowState": "The 'resource curse' is a political condition rooted in the hollow state left by Belgium. This system was entrenched after independence with the CIA and Belgian-backed assassination of pan-Africanist leader Patrice Lumumba, who was eliminated for his vision of resource sovereignty that threatened Western corporate control over Congo's wealth [Belgian Parliamentary Commission, 2001]. The subsequent installation of the kleptocrat Mobutu Sese Seko ensured the state's weakness could be actively exploited by external actors who benefit from the inability to regulate mining, ensuring resources flow out while violence stays in."
