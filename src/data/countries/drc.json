  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a resource war fought over its vast mineral wealthâ€”cobalt, coltan, and goldâ€”that powers the global tech and 'green' energy industries. The conflict involves the Congolese army, over 100 armed groups, and foreign-backed militias, notably Rwanda's M23 [UN Group of Experts on the DRC, 2023]. It has created one of the world's worst displacement crises and is characterised by the systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Belgium (King Leopold II & the Belgian State)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of Belgium's exceptionally brutal colonial rule. King Leopold II's personal Congo Free State (1885-1908) was a slave state built on a 'Red Rubber' terror system, where millions were killed or mutilated to extract rubber and ivory [Adam Hochschild, 'King Leopold's Ghost', 1998]. The subsequent Belgian state continued this purely extractive model, intentionally building no viable local institutions and leaving behind a hollow state at independence. This colonial architecture, designed for efficient extraction by outsiders, perfectly conditioned the nation for the neocolonial scramble for resources that defines the DRC today."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "conflictMineralsAndProxyWars": "The DRC's mineral wealth is a curse, fuelling a neocolonial proxy war over 'blood minerals'. Neighbouring states, particularly Rwanda and Uganda, have repeatedly invaded and armed militias (like the M23) to illegally extract and traffic these resources [UN Group of Experts on the DRC, 2023]. Fueled by unchecked demand from Western tech and automotive companies, these regional powers act as violent intermediaries, profiting from the chaos.",
    "theHollowState": "The 'resource curse' is a political condition rooted in the hollow state left by Belgium. This system was entrenched after independence with the CIA and Belgian-backed assassination of pan-Africanist leader Patrice Lumumba [Belgian Parliamentary Commission, 2001] and the installation of the kleptocrat Mobutu Sese Seko, a key Western ally during the Cold War. Today, the state's weakness is actively exploited by external actors who benefit from the inability to control borders or regulate mining, ensuring resources flow out while violence stays in."
