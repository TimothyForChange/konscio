  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a long-running, deadly contest over vast mineral wealth â€” cobalt, coltan, tin and gold â€” **essential to global tech supply chains**. This fuels what many call **'green colonialism'**: the Global North's energy transition depends on minerals extracted through **violence, dispossession, and child labour** in the Global South. Armed control over mines and opaque corporate purchasing link multinational companies to a system that **extracts value while externalising immense human cost**.\n\nThe conflict involves the Congolese army, numerous militias, and **foreign-backed groups like M23**. **Regional interference** (notably from Rwanda and Uganda) fuels cycles of violence and mass displacement. Sexual violence is endemic as a weapon of war. Eastern provinces endure waves of **forced displacement** and attacks, driven by the **struggle for resource control**.\n\nThe resulting human suffering is catastrophic, making this conflict one of the world's deadliest since WWII, directly caused by the **scramble for minerals** and **geopolitical manoeuvring**. **Accountability** for widespread abuses and **illicit resource exploitation** remains minimal. Ending the crisis requires halting **external military interference**, enforcing **corporate accountability** in supply chains, and centring **Congolese-led justice and development**.",

    "legacy": "The contemporary crisis is rooted in Belgium's **extraction-first colonial project**. King Leopold II's **Congo Free State** treated the territory as a private resource, unleashing **forced labour**, violence and mass mortality to extract rubber and other commodities. After 1908, Belgian state rule continued a **political economy designed for extraction** rather than local development.\n\nBelgian **colonial institutions** prioritised mineral concession systems, segregated labour regimes and elite-friendly governance that hollowed out public institutions. The post-independence state inherited weak institutions, clientelist networks and **externally oriented extraction models** that made the region vulnerable to predatory neighbours, **multinational corporations**, and armed actors seeking control of mineral rents."

As a key **Cold War client**, Mobutu received billions in Western aid in exchange for anti-communist alignment and favourable access for **foreign corporations**. He perfected a system of **kleptocracy**, personally embezzling billions while the state disintegrated. When the **Cold War** ended and his patrons abandoned him, the country, crippled by **odious debt**, was subjected to **IMF-led Structural Adjustment Programmes** enforcing **austerity** and sealing the **state's total collapse**, creating the vacuum for the Congo Wars."
