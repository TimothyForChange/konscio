  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a deadly contest over vast **mineral wealth** (cobalt, coltan etc.) essential to **global tech supply chains**. This fuels '**green colonialism**': the Global North's energy transition depends on minerals extracted through **violence, dispossession, and child labour**. Armed control over mines links **multinational companies** to a system that **extracts value while externalising human cost**.\n\nThe conflict involves the army, militias, and **foreign-backed groups** (M23). **Regional interference** (Rwanda, Uganda) fuels violence and mass displacement. Sexual violence is endemic. Suffering is catastrophic, caused by the **scramble for minerals** and **geopolitical manoeuvring**. **Accountability** for **illicit resource exploitation** remains minimal. Solutions require halting **external military interference**, enforcing **corporate accountability**, and centring **Congolese-led justice**.",

Belgian state rule continued a **political economy designed for extraction**.\n\n**Colonial institutions** prioritised mineral concessions and segregated labour, hollowing out public institutions. The post-independence state inherited weak structures and **externally oriented extraction models**, making it vulnerable to predatory actors seeking **mineral rents**."

He perfected **kleptocracy**, embezzling billions while the state disintegrated. Post-**Cold War**, abandoned by patrons and crippled by **odious debt**, the country faced **IMF-led Structural Adjustment Programmes** (**austerity**), sealing the **state's total collapse** and leading to the Congo Wars."
