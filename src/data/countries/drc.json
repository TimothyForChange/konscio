  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a long-running, deadly contest over vast mineral wealth â€” cobalt, coltan, tin and gold â€” that are critical to global tech and renewable-energy supply chains.\n\nThis has produced what many analysts call 'green colonialism' or 'green imperialism': the Global North's clean-energy transition depends on supply chains that are tied to violence, economic dispossession and child labour in the Global South. Armed control over mines, opaque trade routes and corporate purchasing practices link multinational companies to a system that extracts value while externalising the human cost.\n\nThe conflict involves the Congolese armed forces, scores of local militias and foreign-backed groups such as M23. Regional interference, notably allegations of Rwandan and Ugandan support for proxy militias, has fuelled repeated cycles of violence, mass displacement and severe protection crises. Sexual violence is widely used as a tactic of war, and eastern provinces face repeated waves of forced displacement, food insecurity and attacks on civilians.\n\nHumanitarian needs are enormous: nearly 7 million internally displaced people, more than a million refugees abroad, and over 25 million people requiring assistance in recent humanitarian planning. The scale of death and suffering since the late 1990s is contested by methodology, but independent studies have documented millions of conflict-related deaths and sustained, multi-decade devastation that rank the crisis among the world's deadliest since World War II.\n\nAccountability has been limited. UN Group of Experts reports, civil-society investigations and human-rights organisations have documented state and non-state abuses, illegal exploitation of resources, and networks that benefit from the violence. Ending the crisis requires halting external military interference, enforcing corporate transparency and due diligence across supply chains, and centring Congolese-led justice and development efforts.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Belgium (Congo Free State & Belgian Congo, 1885-1960)",
    "legacy": "The contemporary crisis is rooted in Belgium's extraction-first colonial project. King Leopold II's Congo Free State treated the territory as a private resource, unleashing forced labour, violence and mass mortality to extract rubber and other commodities. After 1908, Belgian state rule continued a political economy designed for extraction rather than local development.\n\nBelgian colonial institutions prioritised mineral concession systems, segregated labour regimes and elite-friendly governance that hollowed out public institutions and legal protections. The post-independence state inherited weak institutions, clientelist networks and externally oriented extraction models that made the region vulnerable to predatory neighbours, multinational corporations and armed actors seeking control of mineral rents."

  "historicalContext": {
    "conflictMineralsAndForeignInfluence": "Eastern Congo's mineral wealth sits at the intersection of local militias, regional strategic interests and global markets. Armed groups and complicit intermediaries control mines, tax artisanal production and smuggle valuable minerals into international supply chains. Investigations by UN panels, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch document forced evictions, labour abuses and supply-chain opacity that connect extractive industries to human-rights violations.\n\nThe demand for minerals associated with electronics, batteries and vehicles creates incentives for territorial control by armed groups and for states to project influence across borders. Corporate due-diligence gaps and weak regulatory enforcement in sourcing countries allow these systems to persist.",
    "thePostColonialStateAndExternalInterference": "Post-colonial Congo has repeatedly been shaped by foreign interventions and geopolitical manoeuvring. The assassination of Patrice Lumumba with Belgian and US complicity undermined early attempts at sovereign resource control. Subsequent authoritarian rule under Mobutu entrenched kleptocratic extraction and weakened state capacity. Regional wars (1996-2003) and continuing interventions by neighbouring states turned eastern DRC into a theatre where access to resources, counter-insurgency and regional rivalry overlap, sustaining long-term instability.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "Multiple international mechanisms have engaged with the DRC crisis. The UN Group of Experts on the DRC has repeatedly documented regional support for armed groups and illicit exploitation of resources (notably in reports such as S/2024/432). National and international investigations, civil-society documentation and occasional prosecutions have exposed abuses, but systemic accountability remains limited. Remedies require both criminal accountability for serious violations and structural reforms to ensure resource governance, corporate responsibility and reparations for affected communities."

    "refugees": "More than 1 million refugees and asylum-seekers from the DRC are hosted in neighbouring countries, compounding a protracted regional displacement crisis.",
    "casualties": "Estimates of conflict-related deaths since the late 1990s vary with methodology. Some independent mortality surveys and reviews estimate several million excess deaths; while numbers differ, the scale of human loss across decades is widely acknowledged to be in the millions.",
    "affected": "Humanitarian planning documents have identified roughly 25.4 million people in need of assistance in recent years, with millions facing acute food insecurity, shelter needs and protection risks.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Millions of children in conflict-affected provinces are out of school, with education systems repeatedly disrupted by fighting and displacement.",
    "sexualViolence": "Sexual and gender-based violence is endemic in eastern provinces; medical and protection providers report tens of thousands of survivors treated in recent years, with spikes in incidents during periods of intense fighting.",
    "livelihoodsAndEconomicLoss": "Communities dependent on artisanal and small-scale mining face dispossession, forced labour and diminished livelihoods as armed actors and commercial interests capture mining zones."
