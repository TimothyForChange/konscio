  "currentCrisisSummary": "Eastern DRC is the epicentre of a resource war fought over its vast mineral wealthâ€”cobalt, coltan, and goldâ€”which is essential for the global tech and 'green' energy industries. This creates a stark contradiction known as 'green colonialism': the Global North's transition to 'clean' energy is directly reliant on supply chains fuelled by extreme violence and child labour in the Global South. The conflict involves the Congolese army, over 100 armed groups, and foreign-backed militias, notably Rwanda's M23 [UN Group of Experts, 2023]. It has created one of the world's worst displacement crises and is characterised by the systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war [UN, 2024].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Belgium (Congo Free State & Belgian Congo, 1885-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of Belgium's notoriously brutal colonial rule. King Leopold II's personal Congo Free State (1885-1908) functioned as a private slave state, leading to the death and mutilation of millions to extract rubber and ivory. After taking over, the Belgian state continued a model of pure extraction, deliberately neglecting the development of viable local institutions. This colonial structure, designed solely for resource exploitation, left the nation deeply vulnerable to the neo-colonial scramble for minerals that benefits multinational corporations today."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "conflictMineralsAndProxyWars": "The DRC's mineral wealth has fuelled a neo-colonial conflict over what are often termed 'conflict minerals'. The system functions as a violent supply chain where neighbouring states, particularly Rwanda, arm proxy militias like M23 to control mines and smuggle resources [UN Group of Experts, 2023]. These minerals are then laundered into global markets through supply chains that are deliberately kept opaque. This structure allows multinational tech and automotive companies to profit from cheap raw materials while claiming plausible deniability about the violent, criminal origins of their components.",
    "theHollowState": "The 'resource curse' is a political condition rooted in the hollow state left by Belgium. This was entrenched after independence with the CIA and Belgian-backed assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the DRC's first prime minister [Belgian Parliamentary Commission, 2001]. Lumumba's murder was the foundational act of neo-colonialism in the Congo, a clear message that resource sovereignty would not be tolerated. His removal and the subsequent installation of the kleptocrat Mobutu Sese Seko ensured the state remained a facilitator for foreign extraction, unable to regulate mining or protect its citizens. This system allows external actors to exploit the violence and extract resources with impunity."

    "casualties": "An estimated 6 million people have died from conflict-related causes since 1998, making it one of the world's deadliest conflicts since World War II [IRC, 2007]. The death toll continues to climb.",
