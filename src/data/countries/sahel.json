  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) suffers a severe crisis born from **converging structural violence**: weak governance **inherited from colonialism and gutted by neoliberalism**, jihadist insurgencies **fuelled by state collapse and foreign interventions**, recurrent coups reflecting **popular rejection of neo-colonial security models**, and **accelerating climate shocks**.\n\nRecent military takeovers signal a shift, creating a new geopolitical frontline. The violence, driven by armed groups and **predatory control of resources**, inflicts mass displacement and starvation, collapsing public services. The human cost is amplified by **long-term extractive relations** and **external interference** shaping regional policy. Ending the suffering requires **Sahelian-led political solutions**, urgent aid, and dismantling the **extractive and militarised responses** imposed from outside.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (c. 1890s-1960)",
    "legacy": "French colonial rule reorganised borders, economies and governance in ways that privileged extraction and centre-periphery hierarchies. At independence around 1960, formal sovereignty did not erase these structures: monetary arrangements (notably the CFA franc), security pacts and dense political networks known as 'FranÃ§afrique' allowed continued French influence over economic policy, resource flows and military cooperation.\n\nThese arrangements left fragile state institutions, economies oriented towards raw-material export, and governance models that were poorly resourced to provide security and services for rural populations â€” conditions that contributed to the later emergence of violent insurgency and chronic instability."

    {
      "title": "Neoliberalism and the Hollowed-Out State",
      "description": "During the debt crises of the 1980s and 1990s, Sahelian states were forced to adopt IMF and World Bank-led Structural Adjustment Programmes. These neoliberal policies mandated severe austerity, dismantling public services, agricultural support, and state employment. This 'hollowing out' of the state was particularly acute in rural and northern areas, creating a governance vacuum, destroying livelihoods, and eroding trust in central authorities. This state retreat is a direct root cause of the current insurgencies, which often thrive by offering alternative forms of justice and order to abandoned populations."

    {
      "title": "The War on Terror and Failed Interventions",
      "description": "After 2001, the Sahel became a key frontier in the global 'War on Terror', prioritising militarised responses over political solutions. The 2011 NATO-led intervention in Libya, a prime example of this approach, deliberately dismantled a stable regional state, creating a massive power vacuum. This collapse directly fuelled the 2012 Mali insurgency by dispersing weapons and fighters across the region. Subsequent French interventions (like Operation Barkhane) continued this security-first approach, creating dependency and a popular backlash that contributed to the recent wave of anti-French coups."
    },
    {
      "title": "Resource Extraction and Neo-Colonialism",
      "description": "The region's poverty is juxtaposed with immense mineral wealth coveted by foreign powers. Niger, for example, has been a strategic source of uranium for the French nuclear industry for decades. This relationship has been classically neo-colonial, with French state-owned corporations extracting vast profits while the host nation suffers environmental damage and remains impoverished. This pattern of resource plunder is a primary driver of popular anti-French sentiment and the recent push for sovereignty by the new military juntas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Climate Change and Regional Instability",
      "description": "The Sahel is on the frontline of the climate emergency despite contributing minimally to global emissions. Accelerating desertification, changing rainfall patterns and extreme weather events undermine pastoral and agrarian livelihoods, worsening competition over land and water and increasing community vulnerability. Many analysts describe this as a form of climatic injustice â€” or 'climate colonialism' â€” in which the costs of Northern industrialisation are disproportionately borne by Sahelian communities."

    {
      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "There are growing calls for accountability around cross-border military support, illicit trafficking of arms and natural-resource exploitation that help sustain armed groups. UN panels, regional bodies and civil-society investigations have documented illicit resource flows and external support to armed actors; addressing these transnational dynamics is essential for long-term peace and reparative justice."
