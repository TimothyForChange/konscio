  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel is the epicentre of one of the world's most neglected crises [NRC, 2024], defined by a convergence of state collapse, jihadist insurgencies, and extreme climate shocks. A recent wave of military coups in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger has been framed as a popular, anti-colonial rejection of a failed French-led security strategy. This has created a new geopolitical frontline in a 21st-century 'scramble for Africa', with external powers competing for influence amid extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (French West Africa, c. 1890s-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of French colonial policies that dismantled pre-existing political and economic systems and carved out artificial states. Upon independence around 1960, France maintained its dominance through the 'FranÃ§afrique' system. This network of monetary control via the CFA franc and military pacts perpetuated a model of raw material extraction, leaving behind fragile state structures and creating the conditions for the current instability."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "franÃ§afriqueAndFailedIntervention": "The crisis highlights the failure of 'FranÃ§afrique'â€”France's strategy for maintaining economic and military influence. Its pillars were the CFA franc, a currency that limited monetary sovereignty, and a military presence often used to protect French corporate interests, such as uranium mines in Niger. The recent French-led 'war on terror' not only failed to stop the spread of violence but also created a lucrative market for the French arms industry. The expulsion of French forces signals a historic break from a neo-colonial relationship that extracted wealth while providing neither security nor development.",
    "climateCollapseAndInjustice": "The Sahel is on the front line of climate injustice. Despite contributing almost nothing to global emissions, the region is warming at 1.5 times the global average [UNDP, 2023], leading to catastrophic desertification. This climate collapse, driven by the industrialised Global North, has destroyed agricultural livelihoods and deepened conflicts over scarce resources. This represents a form of climate colonialism, where the environmental costs of Northern industrialisation are violently outsourced to the Sahel, creating an 'ecological debt' that is yet to be paid."
