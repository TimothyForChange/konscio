  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel is the epicentre of a severe and neglected crisis [NRC, 2024], defined by a convergence of weak governance, jihadist insurgencies, and severe climate shocks. A recent wave of military coups in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger has been framed as a popular rejection of a French-led security strategy that was seen as ineffective. This has created a new geopolitical frontline, with external powers competing for influence amid extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (French West Africa, c. 1890s-1960)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of French colonial policies that altered pre-existing political and economic systems and created new states. Upon independence around 1960, France maintained its influence through a system sometimes called 'FranÃ§afrique'. This network, which included monetary control via the CFA franc and military pacts, perpetuated a model of raw material extraction, leaving behind fragile state structures and contributing to the conditions for the current instability."

  "coreTerms": {
    "postColonialRelationsAndForeignIntervention": "The crisis highlights the challenges of \'FranÃ§afrique\', France\'s strategy for maintaining economic and military influence. Its pillars were the CFA franc, a currency that critics argue limited monetary sovereignty, and a military presence often used to protect French corporate interests, such as uranium mines in Niger. The recent French-led \'war on terror\' did not stop the spread of violence and, according to critics, created a market for the French arms industry. The expulsion of French forces signals a significant break from a post-colonial relationship that, according to critics, extracted wealth while providing neither security nor development.",
    "climateChangeAndRegionalInstability": "The Sahel is on the front line of the climate crisis. Despite contributing almost nothing to global emissions, the region is warming at 1.5 times the global average [UNDP, 2023], leading to severe desertification. This climate change, driven by the industrialised Global North, has damaged agricultural livelihoods and exacerbated conflicts over scarce resources. Critics describe this as a form of \'climate colonialism\', where the environmental costs of Northern industrialisation are disproportionately borne by the Sahel, creating what they term an \'ecological debt\'."
