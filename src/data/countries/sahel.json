  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger) is the epicentre of a severe, neglected crisis defined by the convergence of weak governance, jihadist insurgencies, recurrent coups and accelerating climate shocks.\n\nA recent wave of military takeovers has been framed domestically as a rejection of a French-led security model perceived as ineffective; regionally it has created a new geopolitical frontline with external powers competing for influence. The violence is fuelled by armed groups, intercommunal conflict and predatory control of land and resources, producing mass displacement, chronic food insecurity and a collapsing public-service base.\n\nThe human cost is amplified by long-term patterns of extractive relations and external interventions that have shaped monetary, security and economic policy since independence. The crisis demands Sahelian-led political solutions, urgent humanitarian scale-up and an end to extractive and militarised responses that entrench local suffering.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (French West Africa, c. 1890s-1960)",
    "legacy": "French colonial rule reorganised borders, economies and governance in ways that privileged extraction and centre-periphery hierarchies. At independence around 1960, formal sovereignty did not erase these structures: monetary arrangements (notably the CFA franc), security pacts and dense political networks known as 'FranÃ§afrique' allowed continued French influence over economic policy, resource flows and military cooperation.\n\nThese arrangements left fragile state institutions, economies oriented towards raw-material export, and governance models that were poorly resourced to provide security and services for rural populations â€” conditions that contributed to the later emergence of violent insurgency and chronic instability."
  },
  "historicalContext": {
    "postColonialRelationsAndForeignIntervention": "The Sahel's instability must be read in the context of post-colonial geopolitical competition. France's long-running security interventions (culminating in Operation Barkhane) and subsequent shifts in posture created both dependency and popular backlash. In the last five years a series of coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger further transformed the regional balance, with the formation of the Alliance/Confederation of Sahel States signalling a political realignment.\n\nExternal actors have often prioritised military responses to insurgency rather than political, social and economic solutions, helping create a market for arms and security services while doing little to address structural drivers of violence.",
    "climateChangeAndRegionalInstability": "The Sahel is on the frontline of the climate emergency despite contributing minimally to global emissions. Accelerating desertification, changing rainfall patterns and extreme weather events undermine pastoral and agrarian livelihoods, worsening competition over land and water and increasing community vulnerability. Many analysts describe this as a form of climatic injustice â€” or 'climate colonialism' â€” in which the costs of Northern industrialisation are disproportionately borne by Sahelian communities.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "There are growing calls for accountability around cross-border military support, illicit trafficking of arms and natural-resource exploitation that help sustain armed groups. UN panels, regional bodies and civil-society investigations have documented illicit resource flows and external support to armed actors; addressing these transnational dynamics is essential for long-term peace and reparative justice."
