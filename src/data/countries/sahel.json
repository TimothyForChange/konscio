  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel is the epicentre of a severe and neglected crisis, defined by a convergence of state collapse, jihadist insurgencies, and extreme climate shocks. A recent wave of military coups in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger has been framed as a popular, anti-colonial rejection of a failed French-led security strategy and a struggle for national sovereignty, creating a new geopolitical frontline characterised by extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of French colonial policies that dismantled pre-existing political and economic systems and carved out artificial states. Upon independence around 1960, France maintained its dominance through the 'FranÃ§afrique' system. This network of monetary control via the CFA franc and military pacts perpetuated a model of raw material extraction, leaving behind fragile state structures and creating the conditions for the current instability."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "franÃ§afriqueAndFailedIntervention": "The crisis highlights the failure of 'FranÃ§afrique'â€”France's strategy for maintaining economic and military influence. Its pillars were the CFA franc, a currency system that limited monetary sovereignty, and a military presence often used to protect French corporate interests, such as uranium mines in Niger. The recent French-led 'war on terror' not only failed to stop the spread of violence but also created a lucrative market for the French arms industry. The expulsion of French forces signals a historic break from a neocolonial relationship that critics argue extracted wealth while providing neither security nor development.",
    "climateCollapseAndInjustice": "The Sahel is on the front line of climate injustice. Despite contributing almost nothing to global emissions, the region is warming at 1.5 times the global average, leading to catastrophic desertification. This climate collapse, driven by the industrialised Global North, has destroyed agricultural livelihoods, deepened conflicts over scarce resources, and created a vast recruiting pool for armed groups. This represents a form of climate colonialism, where the environmental costs of industrialisation in the North are disproportionately borne by populations in the Sahel."

    "childrenOutOfSchool": "More than 500,000 children are out of school due to conflict, insecurity, and destruction of educational infrastructure.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "Health system functionality has declined by 40% in conflict-affected areas due to attacks and staff displacement.",
    "foodInsecurity": "More than 25 million people face acute food insecurity across the Sahel, with over 1 million in catastrophic hunger.",
    "waterAccess": "More than 15 million people lack access to safe drinking water due to conflict and climate change impacts."
