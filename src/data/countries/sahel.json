  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel is the epicentre of the world's most neglected and fastest-growing crisis, a convergence of state collapse, jihadist insurgencies, and extreme climate shocks. A wave of military coups in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger has been framed as a popular, anti-colonial rejection of the failed, decade-long French-led military intervention [International Crisis Group, 2023]. The withdrawal of Western forces has left a security vacuum, creating a humanitarian catastrophe and a new geopolitical frontline characterised by extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of French colonial policies. France conquered the region in the late 19th century, shattered ancient political and economic systems, and carved out artificial states with arbitrary borders that fuelled ethnic tensions. The French governed through a policy of assimilation and coercion, building an extractive economy while neglecting local institutions. At independence around 1960, France left behind fragile, dependent states and maintained its dominance through a neocolonial system known as 'FranÃ§afrique', which trapped the region in a cycle of poverty and weak governance, creating the perfect conditions for state failure."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "franÃ§afriqueAndFailedIntervention": "The crisis is an indictment of 'FranÃ§afrique'â€”France's strategy of maintaining economic and military dominance over its former African colonies. The recent military coups are a direct backlash against this system and the failure of the French-led 'war on terror' (Operation Barkhane), which locals saw as an occupying force propping up corrupt elites. The expulsion of the French ambassador and troops from these nations signals a historic, sovereign break from a neocolonial relationship that failed to provide security or development for the Sahelian people.",
    "climateCollapseAndInjustice": "The Sahel is a ground-zero for climate injustice. Despite contributing almost nothing to global carbon emissions, the region is warming at 1.5 times the global average, leading to catastrophic desertification and resource scarcity [IPCC, 2022]. This climate collapse, caused by the industrialised Global North, has destroyed traditional livelihoods, deepened ethnic conflicts over land and water, and created a vast recruiting pool for armed groups. The crisis is an acute example of climate colonialism, where the devastating costs of Western consumption are paid for in Sahelian lives."

    "casualties": "The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, making the Central Sahel one of the deadliest conflict zones in the world [ACLED, 2024].",
    "affected": "More than 35 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance across the region, with millions on the brink of famine [UN OCHA, 2024]."
