  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) suffers a severe crisis born from converging **structural violence**: weak governance inherited from **colonialism** and gutted by **neoliberalism**, jihadist insurgencies fuelled by **state collapse** and **foreign interventions**, recurrent **coups** reflecting popular rejection of **neo-colonial** security models, and accelerating **climate shocks**.\n\nRecent military takeovers signal a shift, creating a new **geopolitical** frontline. Violence, driven by armed groups and **predatory control of resources**, inflicts mass displacement and starvation. The human cost is amplified by long-term **extractive relations** and **external interference**. Ending the suffering requires Sahelian-led political solutions and dismantling **extractive** and **militarised responses** imposed from outside.",

    "colonialPower": "France (c. 1890s-1960)",
    "legacy": "**French colonial rule** reorganised borders and economies favouring **extraction**. At independence, formal sovereignty didn't erase these structures: monetary arrangements (**CFA franc**), security pacts, and '**FranÃ§afrique**' networks allowed continued French influence.\n\nThese arrangements left fragile states, **export-oriented economies**, and weak governance, conditions contributing to later instability."

      "description": "During debt crises (1980s-90s), Sahelian states adopted **IMF/World Bank-led Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)**. These **neoliberal policies** mandated severe **austerity**, dismantling public services. This '**hollowing out**' of the state created a governance vacuum, destroyed livelihoods, and eroded trust, a root cause of current insurgencies."

The 2011 **NATO-led intervention in Libya** dismantled a state, creating a **power vacuum** fuelling the 2012 Mali insurgency. Subsequent **French interventions** (Operation Barkhane) continued this security-first approach, creating **dependency** and backlash leading to **anti-French coups**."
