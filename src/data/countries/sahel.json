  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) suffers a severe crisis born from converging **structural violence**: weak governance inherited from **colonialism** and gutted by **neoliberalism**, jihadist insurgencies fuelled by **state collapse** and **failed Western interventions**, recurrent **coups** reflecting popular rejection of **neo-colonial** security models, and accelerating **climate shocks**.\n\nRecent military takeovers signal a shift, creating a new **geopolitical** frontline involving **Russian mercenaries** (Wagner/Africa Corps). Violence, driven by armed groups and **predatory control of resources**, inflicts mass displacement and starvation. The human cost is amplified by long-term **extractive relations** and **external interference**. Ending the suffering requires Sahelian-led political solutions and dismantling **extractive** and **militarised responses** imposed from outside.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (c. 1890s-1960)",
    "legacy": "**French colonial rule** reorganised borders and economies favouring **extraction**. At independence, formal sovereignty didn't erase these structures: monetary arrangements (**CFA franc**), security pacts, and '**FranÃ§afrique**' networks allowed continued French influence.\n\nThese arrangements left fragile states, **export-oriented economies**, and weak governance, conditions contributing to later instability."

    {
      "title": "Neoliberalism and the Hollowed-Out State",
      "description": "During debt crises (1980s-90s), Sahelian states adopted **IMF/World Bank-led Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)**. These **neoliberal policies** mandated severe **austerity**, dismantling public services. This '**hollowing out**' of the state created a governance vacuum, destroyed livelihoods, and eroded trust, a root cause of current insurgencies."

    {
      "title": "The War on Terror and Failed Interventions",
      "description": "Post-2001, the Sahel became a frontier in the global '**War on Terror**', prioritising militarised responses. The 2011 **NATO-led intervention in Libya** dismantled a state, creating a **power vacuum** fuelling the 2012 Mali insurgency. Subsequent **French interventions** (Operation Barkhane) continued this security-first approach, creating **dependency** and backlash leading to **anti-French coups**."

    {
      "title": "Resource Extraction and Neo-Colonialism",
      "description": "Poverty contrasts with mineral wealth coveted by **foreign powers**. Niger's strategic **uranium** supply for France exemplifies **neo-colonial** relations: French state corporations extract profits while Niger remains impoverished. This **resource plunder** drives **anti-French sentiment**."

      "title": "Russia's Entry: Mercenaries for Minerals",
      "description": "Exploiting the backlash against France, **Russia** has expanded its influence, primarily through **private military contractors** (Wagner Group/Africa Corps). Military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger increasingly rely on these **mercenaries** for regime security, often granting them access to **mining concessions** (gold, etc.). This replicates a **neo-colonial resource-for-security** model, fuelling abuses with **impunity**."

    {
      "title": "ECOWAS Sanctions and Regional Fractures",
      "description": "Following the coups (esp. Niger 2023), the **Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)** imposed **punitive sanctions**, including border closures and asset freezes. Widely seen as illegitimate and externally pressured (by France/West), these sanctions caused **severe humanitarian suffering** (blocking food/medicine), alienated populations, and accelerated the juntas' pivot towards **Russia** and the formation of the **Confederation of Sahel States**."
