  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central Sahel is the epicentre of the world's most neglected crisis, a convergence of state collapse, jihadist insurgencies, and extreme climate shocks. A wave of military coups in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger has been framed as a popular, anti-colonial rejection of a failed French-led intervention and a struggle for sovereignty over natural resources, creating a new geopolitical frontline characterised by extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct legacy of French colonial policies. France conquered the region, shattered ancient political and economic systems, and carved out artificial states. At independence around 1960, France left behind fragile states and maintained its dominance through 'FranÃ§afrique', using monetary control via the CFA franc and military pacts to trap the region in a cycle of poverty and raw material extraction, creating the perfect conditions for state failure."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "franÃ§afriqueAndFailedIntervention": "The crisis is an indictment of 'FranÃ§afrique'â€”France's strategy of maintaining economic and military dominance. Its key pillars were the CFA franc, a colonial currency that prevented monetary sovereignty, and a military presence to protect French corporate interests, such as uranium mines in Niger. The failed 'war on terror', which enriched the French arms industry, was the final stage of this system. The expulsion of French forces signals a historic break from a neocolonial relationship that extracted wealth while providing neither security nor development.",
    "climateCollapseAndInjustice": "The Sahel is ground-zero for climate injustice. Despite contributing almost nothing to global emissions, the region is warming at 1.5 times the global average, leading to catastrophic desertification [IPCC, 2022]. This climate collapse, caused by the industrialised Global North, has destroyed livelihoods, deepened conflicts over land and water, and created a vast recruiting pool for armed groups. The crisis is an acute example of climate colonialism, where the devastating costs of Western consumption are paid for in Sahelian lives."
