  "currentCrisisSummary": "Bangladesh hosts the world's largest and most densely populated refugee settlement, a direct consequence of a campaign of ethnic cleansing and plausible genocide committed by the neighbouring state of Myanmar. Over one million Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority, live in precarious, sprawling camps in Cox's Bazar after being violently driven from their ancestral lands.\n\nThe crisis within Bangladesh is one of protracted displacement, acute humanitarian need, and suspended rights. The refugees face severe overcrowding, limited access to formal education and livelihoods, and high vulnerability to climate shocks like cyclones and floodingâ€”a direct consequence of the imperial legacy of global industrialisation. While Bangladesh, a nation grappling with its own pressures within a neoliberal global economy, bears the immense logistical and financial burden, the crisis's root causes lie entirely within Myanmar's long history of state-sponsored persecution. The international community's failure to hold Myanmar accountable, combined with geopolitical interests that shield the regime, has created a stalemate, trapping the Rohingya in indefinite exile.",

    "colonialPower": "Britain (in Burma, 1785-1948)",
    "legacy": "The Rohingya's statelessness is a direct legacy of British colonial policy in Burma. During their rule, the British administered Burma as a province of India and encouraged the migration of labourers, including many Rohingya, from the Bengal region into Arakan (now Rakhine State) to work on agricultural projects. This movement was fluid, across a border that was a colonial imposition.\n\nAfter Burma's independence in 1948, the new state's nationalist project sought to define a pure 'Burmese' identity. The Rohingya, with their different ethnicity, religion, and colonial-era migration history, were framed as foreign interlopers and 'illegal Bengali migrants'. British 'divide and rule' tactics, which pitted ethnic groups against each other, created the post-colonial resentments that the Myanmar state later weaponised to strip the Rohingya of their identity and citizenship."

  "historicalContext": [
    {
      "title": "State-Sponsored Persecution and Statelessness",
      "description": "The post-colonial Burmese state institutionalised discrimination against the Rohingya. This culminated in the 1982 Citizenship Law, a piece of legislation designed to legally erase the Rohingya's existence. By refusing to recognise them as one of the country's official ethnic groups, the law rendered them stateless in their own homeland. This act of legal violence stripped them of all fundamental rightsâ€”to vote, to travel, to own land, to access educationâ€”and formalised their status as a people to be persecuted with impunity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Violence",
      "description": "The decades of discrimination erupted into systematic, state-directed violence. In 2017, the Myanmar military (the Tatmadaw) launched so-called 'clearance operations' in response to militant attacks. This was a cover for a premeditated and brutal campaign of mass killing, gang rape, and the razing of hundreds of villages. The intent was to terrorise the Rohingya population into fleeing en masse. This violent expulsion, which drove over 750,000 people into Bangladesh in a few months, is now the subject of a genocide case at the International Court of Justice."

    {
      "title": "Geopolitical Indifference and Impunity",
      "description": "Myanmar's military regime has been shielded from meaningful international accountability. China and Russia, citing the principle of non-interference, have used their UN Security Council vetoes to block strong action, protecting their own strategic and economic investments in Myanmar, including projects in Rakhine State itself. Western nations have imposed sanctions but have failed to apply sufficient pressure to alter the regime's behaviour. Regional bodies like ASEAN have adhered to a policy of non-confrontation, effectively normalising the crime and leaving Bangladesh to manage the humanitarian fallout alone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Humanitarian Response and Neoliberal Governance",
      "description": "The international response in Cox's Bazar, while essential, operates within a neoliberal framework. It is a multi-billion dollar aid industry dominated by large international organisations that can sideline local capacity. This model creates a parallel economy and a system of 'governance-by-aid' that manages the crisis in a state of permanent emergency without addressing the political or economic root causes, while placing immense strain on the host nation's own development."
    },
    {
      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "Formal accountability efforts are underway but face significant political obstacles. The Gambia, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, has brought a case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice, accusing it of violating the Genocide Convention. The International Criminal Court has also opened an investigation. These legal processes are vital for documenting the atrocities and challenging state impunity, but their ultimate effectiveness is contingent on the political will of powerful nations to enforce their rulings."
