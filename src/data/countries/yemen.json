  "currentCrisisSummary": "Yemen endures one of the world's most severe humanitarian catastrophes, directly caused by a protracted **proxy war** over state control and its **strategic position** on a key **global trade route**. The conflict, involving a **Saudi-led coalition** (backed by **Western arms**) and Iran-aligned forces, has been waged through **blockades**, **sieges**, and attacks on infrastructure, deliberately crippling the nation.\n\nThis violence and **externally imposed restrictions** have devastated the economy, wrecked public services, and produced **catastrophic hunger and disease**. Aid diversion exacerbates suffering. The crisis is actively sustained by **international arms flows**, **regional rivalries**, and **global economic interests** prioritising strategic gain over human life.",

Britain's **protectorates** and **indirect rule** hindered unity, leaving a **governance vacuum**.\n\nThese **colonial partitions**, plus later **Cold War geopolitics**, created fault-lines exploited by elites and **foreign powers**, contributing to cycles of conflict and **external intervention**."
