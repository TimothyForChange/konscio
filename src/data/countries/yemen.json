  "currentCrisisSummary": "Yemen endures one of the world's most severe humanitarian catastrophes, directly caused by a protracted **proxy war** over state control and its **strategic position** on a key **global trade route**. The conflict, involving a **Saudi-led coalition** (backed by **Western arms**) and Iran-aligned forces, has been waged through **blockades**, **sieges**, and attacks on infrastructure, deliberately crippling the nation.\n\nThis violence and **externally imposed restrictions** have devastated the economy, wrecked public services, and produced **catastrophic hunger and disease**. Aid diversion further exacerbates civilian suffering. The crisis is actively sustained by **international arms flows**, **regional rivalries**, and **global economic interests** prioritising strategic gain over human life.",

    "legacy": "The crisis draws on deep **colonial-era divisions**. **British control** of Aden and the south, alongside **Ottoman administration** in the north, produced distinct legacies. Britain's patchwork of **protectorates** and **indirect rule** hindered unity and left a **governance vacuum**.\n\nThese **colonial partitions**, combined with later **Cold War geopolitics** and international economic policies, created fault-lines exploited by elites and **foreign powers**, contributing to cycles of conflict and **external intervention**."

These **neoliberal \"reforms\"** mandated lifting subsidies, **privatisation**, and severe **austerity**. The resulting hardship disproportionately affected marginalised regions, feeding grievances of southern secessionists and the northern **Houthi rebellion**.

President Saleh exploited **US counter-terrorism aid** to acquire military funding used primarily against domestic opponents, including the **Houthis**. This use of an **imperial security framework** to crush dissent radicalised opposition. This was later supplanted by the current **proxy war**, sustained by large-scale **arms transfers** from Western nations to the **Saudi-led coalition**, enabling violations of **international law**."
