  "currentCrisisSummary": "Yemen endures one of the world's most severe humanitarian catastrophes, driven by a fragmented **proxy war** over state control and its **strategic position** on a key **global trade route**. The conflict involves multiple actors: the Iran-aligned **Houthi movement**, a **Saudi-led coalition** (backed by **Western arms/intelligence**) supporting the internationally recognised government, the **UAE-backed secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC)**, and **Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)**.\n\nThis multi-sided war, waged through **blockades**, **sieges**, and attacks on infrastructure, has deliberately crippled the nation. Violence and **externally imposed restrictions** have devastated the economy, wrecked public services, and produced **catastrophic hunger and disease**. The crisis is actively sustained by **international arms flows**, **regional rivalries** (Saudi/Iran, Saudi/UAE), and **global economic interests**.",

    "legacy": "The crisis draws on deep **colonial-era divisions**. **British control** (south) alongside **Ottoman administration** (north) produced distinct legacies. Britain's **protectorates** and **indirect rule** hindered unity, leaving a **governance vacuum** and fostering **southern identity** later mobilised by secessionists.\n\nThese **colonial partitions**, plus later **Cold War geopolitics**, created fault-lines exploited by elites and **foreign powers**, contributing to cycles of conflict and **external intervention**."

      "description": "Yemen's geography astride the **Bab-el-Mandeb strait**, a vital **chokepoint** for **global trade**, makes it a theatre for **strategic competition**. **Regional powers** (Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE) and global actors seek influence. Control of **maritime access** is a persistent objective for **external actors**."

      "title": "Internal Fragmentation: STC and Southern Secessionism",

The STC frequently clashes with the **Saudi-backed** internationally recognised government forces, despite both nominally opposing the Houthis. This **internal conflict**, driven by secessionist goals and **Saudi-UAE rivalry**, further fragments the state."

      "title": "Neoliberal Reforms and the Roots of Rebellion",
      "description": "Post-unification, Yemen faced **IMF/World Bank-led Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)**. These **neoliberal 'reforms'** mandated lifting subsidies, **privatisation**, and severe **austerity**. Hardship affected marginalised regions, feeding grievances of southern secessionists and the northern **Houthi rebellion**. The Houthi rise was partly a revolt against **corruption** from this **Western-backed economic model**."

      "description": "Yemen has long been a key front in the US '**Global War on Terror**'. **Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)** exploited state weakness to establish a presence. The US conducted extensive **drone strikes** and **special forces operations** against AQAP, often with the complicity of the Saleh regime, which also used US aid against domestic rivals like the **Houthis**. This **external security framework** complicated internal dynamics and contributed to radicalisation."

This intervention received crucial **direct military and intelligence support** from the **US and UK** (refuelling, targeting), alongside massive **arms transfers**. This **Western complicity** enabled the coalition's devastating bombing campaign and naval blockade, key drivers of the humanitarian catastrophe."

The **blockade-induced starvation**, **indiscriminate bombing campaigns**, and **targeting of civilian infrastructure** violate international humanitarian law. Despite formal **accountability** mechanisms, **impunity** persists due to geopolitical interference. The **UN Security Council** remains divided, preventing referral to the **ICC**. **Arms suppliers** (US, UK, France etc.) continue to enable violations with **impunity**, highlighting the **selective application** of international law."
