  "currentCrisisSummary": "Yemen is enduring one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises, driven by a protracted war over control of the state and its strategic position on a key global trade route. The conflict, involving a Saudi-led coalition and Iran-aligned forces in the north, has been sustained in many areas by blockades, sieges and repeated attacks on infrastructure.\n\nThe violence and restrictions on trade and aid have devastated the economy, wrecked public services and produced catastrophic hunger and disease. Large-scale diversion and politicisation of aid in some areas have further reduced humanitarian access and increased civilian suffering. The crisis is sustained by international arms flows, regional rivalries and global economic interests that place strategic and commercial gains above civilian protection.",
  "imperialRoot": {
    "imperialPower": "Britain & Ottoman Empire (Aden 1839-1967; Ottoman presence in the north until 1918)",
    "legacy": "The crisis draws on deep colonial-era divisions. British control of Aden and the south, alongside Ottoman administration in the north, produced two distinct political and administrative legacies. Britain's patchwork of protectorates and indirect rule in the south hindered political unity and left a governance vacuum on withdrawal.\n\nThese colonial partitions, combined with later Cold War geopolitics and international economic policies, helped create fault-lines that were later exploited by domestic elites and foreign powers, contributing to repeated cycles of conflict and external intervention."

  "historicalContext": {
    "geopoliticalChokepointAndGlobalTrade": "Yemen's geography places it astride the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, a vital chokepoint for global trade and energy shipments. Regional powers and global actors have repeatedly sought influence over Yemen's coastline and ports, turning local politics into a theatre for wider strategic competition. Control of maritime access, ports and related infrastructure has therefore been a persistent strategic objective for external actors.",
    "neoliberalReformsAndTheRootsOfRebellion": "Following the 1990 unification, Yemen was subjected to IMF and World Bank-led Structural Adjustment Programmes. These neoliberal 'reforms' mandated the lifting of food and fuel subsidies, privatisation, and severe austerity. The resulting economic hardship disproportionately affected the poor and marginalised regions, leading to popular uprisings and feeding the grievances of both the southern secessionist movement and the northern Houthi rebellion. The rise of the Houthis was, in large part, a populist revolt against the corruption and inequality generated by this Western-backed economic model.",
    "theWarOnTerrorAndForeignIntervention": "The current war was preceded by years of US intervention under the 'Global War on Terror'. During the 2000s, President Saleh's regime skillfully exploited US counter-terrorism aid to acquire military funding and intelligence, which it used not just to fight Al-Qaeda, but primarily to suppress its domestic political opponents, including the Houthis. This use of an imperial security framework to crush internal dissent helped radicalise opposition movements. This was later supplanted by the current proxy war, sustained by large-scale arms transfers from Western nations to the Saudi-led coalition, enabling persistent violations of international law.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "Allegations of unlawful attacks on civilians, blockade-induced starvation and diversion of aid have prompted repeated calls for independent investigation and accountability. UN bodies, rights organisations and some states have documented potential war crimes and human-rights violations. Accountability efforts remain politically contested, but they are central to any longer-term prospect of justice and deterrence."
