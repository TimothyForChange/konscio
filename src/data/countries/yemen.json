  "currentCrisisSummary": "Yemen is suffering one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises, driven by a brutal civil war and a devastating air and sea blockade. The conflict, a proxy war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthis, has shattered infrastructure, caused a human-made famine, and left millions reliant on aid to survive [UN OCHA, 2024].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire & Ottoman Empire",
    "legacy": "The crisis is deeply rooted in colonial division. The British Empire's control of the strategic port of Aden and the south (1839-1967) and Ottoman rule in the north created two distinct political entities. Britain's 'divide and rule' strategy deliberately kept the south fractured into numerous petty sultanates and sheikhdoms, fostering instability and leaving a power vacuum upon withdrawal. This colonial partition laid the groundwork for decades of internal conflict and a weak, fractured state easily exploited by regional powers."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "proxyWarAndWesternComplicity": "The conflict is fundamentally a proxy war between Saudi Arabia (backed by the UAE) and Iran, fought on Yemeni soil. It is enabled by Western powers, particularly the US and UK, which have provided the Saudi-led coalition with weapons, intelligence, and logistical support, making them complicit in the resulting war crimes [Chatham House, 2024; Mwatana for Human Rights]. This intervention has accelerated the total collapse of the Yemeni state for regional geopolitical gain.",
    "theForgottenWar": "Despite the immense suffering, the war is often dubbed the 'forgotten war'. This is not accidental but a consequence of the perpetrators' key geopolitical alliances, which discourages sustained, critical media coverage in the West. This silence has allowed widespread human rights violations by all parties to continue with little accountability, perpetuating a cycle of aid dependency and despair."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 4.5 million people have been internally displaced, many forced to flee multiple times [UNHCR, 2024].",
    "refugees": "Tens of thousands of Yemenis have become refugees and asylum seekers, particularly in the Horn of Africa.",
    "casualties": "Hundreds of thousands have died from both direct causes (airstrikes, fighting) and indirect causes (famine, disease). The destruction of sanitation infrastructure led to one of the largest cholera epidemics in modern history [UN, 2023].",
    "affected": "An estimated 18.2 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance, with millions on the brink of starvation in what the UN has repeatedly called the world's worst humanitarian crisis [USA for UNHCR, 2024]."
