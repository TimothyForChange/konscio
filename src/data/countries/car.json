  "currentCrisisSummary": "The Central African Republic (CAR) endures protracted **state collapse**, driven by decades of **foreign interference**, a **predatory state structure** inherited from **colonialism**, and systematic **resource extraction**. Government authority is negligible, with much of the country controlled by armed groups and **foreign mercenaries**.\n\nThis power vacuum is a legacy of a **neo-colonial model** where external powers (France, now Russia) cultivate clients for resource access. The current phase involves reliance on **Russian private military contractors** (Africa Corps/Wagner) providing regime security for **mining concessions**. This **mercenary-driven extraction** perpetuates violence, displacement, and siphons wealth, inflicting extreme suffering.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (c. 1894-1960)",
    "legacy": "**French colonial rule** was brutal and **extractive**. The territory was leased to private **concessionary companies** using **forced labour**. This established the state as an instrument of **violent resource extraction**.\n\nThis structure persisted post-independence as France handed power to compliant elites. The legacy is a chronically weak, illegitimate state where **resource control** drives conflict."

France repeatedly intervened militarily to install/depose client rulers (like Bokassa) to safeguard interests (**uranium**). This persistent **interference** prevented sovereignty and entrenched dependency."

This **neoliberal shock therapy** weakened the state, deepened poverty, entrenched **aid reliance**, creating a vacuum for armed groups."

      "description": "CAR is a theatre for **geopolitical competition** (France vs. Russia). The turn to **Wagner Group/Africa Corps** shifts **imperial patrons**. This model trades **mineral rights for mercenary services**, bypassing state-building. It creates a parallel economy of violence and **extraction**, where **Russian mercenaries** operate with **impunity**, committing abuses."

Mechanisms are under-resourced, politically constrained, unable to address powerful actors (**foreign mercenaries** enjoying **de facto immunity**). Justice is undermined by focusing on local groups while foreign entities profiting from **illicit resource trade** face no scrutiny."

It is named Ubangi-Shari and its colonisation is driven by the pursuit of ivory and the potential for rubber, establishing the legal and military basis for a system of pure extraction."
