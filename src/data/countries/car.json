  "currentCrisisSummary": "A protracted civil war has rendered the state almost entirely non-existent outside the capital, Bangui. The conflict is characterised by extreme violence between a weak, mercenary-dependent government and a fragmented array of armed groups. Foreign powers, notably France and Russia, intervene not to build peace but to secure geopolitical influence and plunder the nation's vast mineral wealth (diamonds, gold, uranium), perpetuating a catastrophic, and intentionally overlooked, humanitarian crisis.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (Ubangi-Shari, 1894-1960)",
    "legacy": "The Central African Republic is a purely artificial colonial creation, violently forged by France from diverse societies with no shared history. Its sole purpose was the brutal, large-scale extraction of resources like ivory and rubber through a concessionary system that institutionalised forced labour and extreme violence [GÃ©rard Prunier, 2013]. The French regime destroyed indigenous political structures and established a predatory state apparatus designed only for plunder. This system of a 'hollow state' was handed over at independence in 1960 and perpetuated through the 'FranÃ§afrique' system of client dictators (like the infamous Emperor Bokassa), ensuring the country remained a source of raw materials for France, devoid of genuine sovereignty or development [Roland Marchal, 2017]."

  "coreTerms": {
    "stateFailureByDesign": "The post-colonial state in CAR inherited the logic of its French colonial predecessor: it was never designed to provide services or security to its people, but to extract wealth for a tiny elite and their foreign backers. This foundational emptiness means that when the state is challenged, it doesn't just weaken, it evaporates, creating a power vacuum that armed groups, warlords, and foreign mercenariesâ€”from French 'advisors' to Russia's Wagner Group (now Africa Corps)â€”are quick to fill.",
    "predatoryInternationalIntervention": "Foreign interventions are framed as humanitarian or stabilising missions but function as a continuation of colonial exploitation. France's multiple military operations (e.g., Sangaris) have consistently prioritised French interests over Central African lives, often re-shuffling the political elite without addressing root causes. More recently, Russia's Wagner Group has propped up the state in exchange for unimpeded access to mineral concessions, operating with total impunity and committing mass atrocities to secure mining sites. The population is trapped between a phantom state and foreign predators fighting over its resources."

    "displaced": "Over 536,000 people are internally displaced (IDPs), living in constant fear and with little to no access to aid [UN OCHA, 2025].",

    "casualties": "While no exact figure exists due to the chaos, tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in successive waves of conflict since 2012. Atrocities, including mass killings and sexual violence used as a weapon of war, are widespread [Human Rights Watch, 2024].",
    "affected": "3.4 million people, over half the entire population, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance and protection to survive [UN OCHA, 2025]."
