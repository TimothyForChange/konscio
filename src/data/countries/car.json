  "currentCrisisSummary": "A protracted civil war has rendered the state largely non-existent outside the capital, Bangui. The conflict is characterised by extreme violence between a weak, foreign-backed government and a fragmented array of armed groups. Foreign powers, notably France and Russia, have intervened to secure geopolitical influence and access to the nation's vast mineral wealth (diamonds, gold, uranium). This competition for resources perpetuates the conflict and fuels a catastrophic humanitarian crisis that receives little international attention.",

    "colonialPower": "France (Ubangi-Shari, 1894-1960)",
    "legacy": "The Central African Republic's borders are a colonial creation, forged by France from diverse societies with little shared history. The colonial economy was based on the large-scale extraction of resources like ivory and rubber, primarily through a concessionary company system that relied on forced labour and extreme violence. France dismantled existing political structures, replacing them with a state apparatus designed for resource extraction rather than public welfare. After independence, this model was perpetuated through the 'FranÃ§afrique' network, which supported client dictators like Emperor Bokassa to ensure French corporate access to raw materials. This legacy of a state built for extraction, not governance, remains a root cause of its chronic instability."

  "coreTerms": {
    "laCentrafriqueProfonde": "The post-colonial state in CAR inherited the logic of its French predecessor: a structure focused on extracting wealth for a small elite and their foreign partners, rather than providing security or services to the population. This lack of genuine state function means that outside the capital, state authority often collapses entirely when challenged. The resulting power vacuum is filled by armed groups, local warlords, and foreign mercenaries, such as Russia's Africa Corps, who compete violently for control over territory and resources.",
    "mercenaryStateAndProxyPlunder": "Foreign interventions, often framed as stabilising missions, frequently function as a continuation of resource-driven exploitation. France's operations, such as Sangaris, have been criticised for prioritising French strategic interests. More recently, Russia's Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group) has provided critical security for the government in exchange for lucrative mineral concessions, with its forces being accused of mass atrocities while securing mining sites. The country has become an arena for competition between foreign powers, where control over strategic resources is paid for by the lives of Central Africans."
