  "currentCrisisSummary": "A protracted civil war has weakened state authority outside the capital, Bangui. The conflict is characterised by violence between a weak government, which receives foreign support, and a fragmented array of armed groups. Foreign powers, including the former colonial ruler France and Russia, have intervened to protect their geopolitical interests and access the nation's vast mineral wealth (diamonds, gold, uranium). This competition for resources has been a major factor perpetuating the conflict and has contributed to a severe humanitarian crisis, consistently ranked among the world's most neglected [NRC, 2024].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (Ubangi-Shari, 1894-1960)",
    "legacy": "The Central African Republic's borders were established during the colonial era, forged by France from diverse societies with little shared history. The colonial economy was based on the large-scale extraction of resources like ivory and rubber, primarily through a concessionary company system that relied on forced labour and resulted in significant violence. France altered existing political structures, replacing them with a state apparatus designed for resource extraction, not public welfare. After independence, this model continued, with close ties between French and Central African elites ensuring continued access to raw materials for French corporations. This legacy of a state focused on extraction rather than broad-based governance is considered a root cause of its chronic instability."

  "coreTerms": {
    "laCentrafriqueProfonde": "The post-colonial state in CAR largely continued the structure of its French predecessor, which was focused on extracting wealth for a small elite and their foreign partners, rather than providing security or services. This lack of state function means that outside the capital, state authority often collapses. The resulting power vacuum is filled by various actors, including armed groups, local warlords, and foreign security contractors like Russia's Africa Corps, who compete for control over territory and resources.",
    "foreignInterventionAndResourceExtraction": "Foreign interventions, often publicly framed as stabilising missions, are seen by critics as a continuation of resource-driven exploitation. Critics argue that motives of profit and geopolitical control are sometimes masked by public justifications of humanitarianism. France's operations, such as Sangaris, have been criticised for prioritising French strategic interests. More recently, Russia's Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group) has provided security for the government in exchange for mineral concessions, and its forces have been accused of significant human rights abuses while securing mining sites [UN Panel of Experts, 2023; Human Rights Watch, 2022]."
