  "currentCrisisSummary": "Following the chaotic US withdrawal and Taliban takeover in 2021, Afghanistan has been plunged into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. This is not simply a consequence of the new regime, but a direct result of a US-led economic war. The freezing of Afghanistan's central bank assets and crippling sanctions have deliberately induced a famine, collapsed the healthcare system, and erased two decades of fragile gains, particularly for women and girls, who face a systematic gender apartheid [UN Special Rapporteurs, 2023].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire, Russian Empire, Soviet Union & United States",
    "legacy": "Afghanistan's tragedy is a product of being treated as a strategic chessboard for imperial powers for over two centuries. The 19th-century Anglo-Russian 'Great Game' carved up the region and established a pattern of foreign interference that destroyed indigenous political development. This imperial dynamic was supercharged during the Cold War, when the US and USSR turned Afghanistan into their proxy battleground. The CIA's Operation Cyclone armed and funded the Mujahideen to bleed the Soviets [Steve Coll, 'Ghost Wars', 2004], deliberately fostering a radicalised militancy and shattering the Afghan state, leaving it perfectly primed for decades of perpetual conflict."

  "coreTerms": {
    "theGraveyardOfEmpiresMyth": "This colonial moniker is a self-serving imperial myth. It deceptively frames Afghanistan as an inherently chaotic and ungovernable land, obscuring the truth that it is the empires themselves that do the grave-digging. Each invasionâ€”British, Soviet, Americanâ€”systematically destroyed local institutions, armed factional clients, and obliterated social cohesion. The invaders then cite the resulting chaos, which they manufactured, as proof of Afghan backwardness, thus absolving themselves of their role as the primary architects of the nation's destruction.",
    "humanitarianBlackmailAndEconomicWarfare": "The current famine is not a natural disaster; it is a political choice. After their military defeat, the US and its allies weaponised the global financial system to wage economic war. By freezing $7 billion of Afghanistan's own sovereign wealth and enforcing a punitive sanctions regime, they have effectively held 40 million Afghan civilians hostage [Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2022]. This constitutes collective punishment on a mass scale, using the manufactured suffering of ordinary people as a tool of geopolitical leverage against the Taliban regime."

    "casualties": "Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict since 2001, including over 70,000 civilians. The post-2021 economic collapse is now driving excess deaths from starvation and disease [Costs of War Project, Brown University].",
