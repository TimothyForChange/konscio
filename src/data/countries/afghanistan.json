  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since the US withdrawal and the Taliban takeover in August 2021, Afghanistan has descended into a deep and protracted humanitarian emergency. Millions face acute food insecurity and malnutrition, public services have largely collapsed, and the economy has been crippled by the freezing of central bank assets and broad financial restrictions that isolate the country from the global economy.\n\nThese policies â€” including the effective freezing of roughly $7 billion of sovereign reserves abroad â€” and a regime of sanctions and de-facto financial exclusion have drastically reduced state capacity and access to imports, with acute consequences for health, food, shelter and employment. The situation reverses fragile development gains that were dependent on external financing and has produced mass displacement, rising poverty, and heightened vulnerability for women, girls and minorities who now face systematic restrictions and exclusion.\n\nThe humanitarian emergency is not only the result of internal political change but is also sustained by international economic and geopolitical choices: Western governments' asset freezes, conditionalities and wide sanctions regimes have had direct, measurable effects on livelihoods and public services. The immediate needs are immense, and the country requires large-scale, sustained humanitarian support that is accountable to Afghan civil society and led by Afghan organisations where possible.",

    "legacy": "Afghanistan's contemporary fragility is embedded in a long history of foreign intervention. In the 19th century the 'Great Game' between the British and Russian empires reshaped frontier politics and weakened indigenous centres of authority. Soviet intervention (1979-1989) and the Cold War proxy struggles that preceded it precipitated decades of violent conflict and state collapse. The US intervention after 2001 created a hollow, aid-dependent rentier state. This nation-building project was fundamentally neoliberal, prioritising privatisation, outsourcing basic services to a vast network of foreign contractors and NGOs, and imposing a market-based model that fuelled systemic corruption and was unsustainable without massive external financing.\n\nEach major intervention reshaped Afghan social, economic and political institutions, often entrenching dependency, fragmenting local governance and amplifying violent non-state actors. The repeated external remaking of Afghanistan has therefore been a structural driver of instability and humanitarian vulnerability."

  "historicalContext": {
    "theGraveyardOfEmpiresMyth": "The phrase 'graveyard of empires' is a trope that individualises failure and obscures the central role of sustained foreign interference. Successive imperial and great-power campaigns sought to reorder Afghan society and state institutions to serve external strategic aims â€” a process that frequently undermined local political autonomy and social cohesion. Rather than an inherent incapacity, much of Afghanistan's instability must be read as the product of repeated external interventions and extractive geopolitical competition.",
    "theOpiumEconomyAndTheWarOnDrugs": "The 20-year international presence operated alongside a massive opium economy. Western-led counter-narcotics strategies, framed as a 'war on drugs', consistently failed and had perverse effects: they criminalised impoverished farmers who lacked alternative livelihoods, enriched corrupt officials and warlords involved in trafficking, and functioned as another misguided external policy that destabilised rural society while ignoring the root causes of poppy cultivation.",
    "economicPressureAndSanctions": "After August 2021 international financial measures â€” notably the freezing of roughly $7 billion in central bank reserves held overseas and restrictions on formal banking relations â€” have constrained Afghanistan's ability to import, pay salaries and deliver public services. Multilateral and unilateral sanctions, plus restrictive de-risking by international banks and donors' conditionalities, have contributed to economic contraction, spiralling unemployment, and a sharp deterioration in living standards. Many analysts and humanitarian actors argue that these measures, as they have been applied, function as forms of economic coercion that disproportionately punish civilians and limit humanitarian space.\n\nThese pressures have compounded the impacts of climate shocks, conflict and displacement, producing one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world today.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "While the post-2021 context raises urgent humanitarian questions, there are also accountability dimensions connected to earlier interventions and the conduct of armed actors. Investigations, reporting and academic research have documented violations and long-term harm associated with successive periods of foreign military action, proxy support and state collapse. Although formal international accountability mechanisms have been limited or contested, documenting abuses and supporting Afghan civil society and survivors remains essential for redress and longer-term justice."
