  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, Afghanistan endures widespread suffering driven by **economic collapse** and the **systematic dismantling of civil society**. This crisis is co-driven by two primary factors:\n\n1.  **External economic warfare**: The freezing of $7 billion in central bank assets and broad **financial restrictions** imposed by Western powers, which function as **collective punishment** and cripple the state.\n\n2.  **Internal Taliban repression**: The regime's implementation of **gender apartheid**, including the **systematic exclusion of women** from education and employment, which has shattered 50% of the workforce, collapsed household incomes, and fatally crippled humanitarian aid delivery.\n\nThese dynamics, layered upon the legacy of a 20-year, **aid-dependent rentier state**, have produced one of the world's worst humanitarian emergencies.",

    "legacy": "Afghanistan's fragility is embedded in a long history of **foreign intervention**. The 19th century **'Great Game'** reshaped politics. **Soviet intervention** (1979-1989) precipitated conflict. Simultaneously, **Pakistan's 'strategic depth' doctrine** fuelled the conflict, with its **intelligence services (ISI)** cultivating, funding, and providing sanctuary to the Taliban to serve its own regional interests.\n\nThe **US intervention** after 2001 created a hollow, **aid-dependent rentier state**. This project was fundamentally **neoliberal** and corrupt, prioritising **privatisation**, outsourcing to **foreign contractors**, and empowering a network of **warlords**, hollowing out the state from its inception."

      "title": "Pakistan and 'Strategic Depth'",
      "description": "Afghanistan's instability is inseparable from **Pakistan's regional ambitions**. Seeking 'strategic depth' against India, Pakistan's **Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)** has for decades pursued a policy of interference, most decisively through the creation, funding, sanctuary, and military support for the **Taliban insurgency**. This **state-sponsorship** was the primary enabler of the Taliban's 2021 victory."

      "title": "The Warlord-Contractor State (2001-2021)",
      "description": "The 20-year **US-led occupation** was not a 'failed' state-building project but a *successful* one that built the intended state: a hollow shell. Power was **devolved to allied warlords** who were empowered with impunity. This created a **corrupt elite** loyal to **foreign contracts** and **aid flows**, not the population. The **Afghan National Army** was a paper tiger, dissolving in 2021 because it was built on this foundation of **systemic corruption**."

      "title": "Taliban Governance and Gender Apartheid",
      "description": "The post-2021 crisis is also **internally driven**. The Taliban's implementation of a rigid, misogynistic ideology amounts to **gender apartheid**. The **banning of women from education and employment** (including for NGOs) has not only erased human rights but has **functionally collapsed the economy** and severely hampered the delivery of humanitarian aid, exacerbating the suffering caused by external sanctions."

Multilateral and **unilateral sanctions** contributed to **economic contraction** and worsened living standards. These function as **economic coercion**, disproportionately punishing civilians.\n\nThese pressures compound **climate shocks** and displacement, producing a massive crisis."

Investigations by UN bodies and civil society have catalogued violations by all parties, but **impunity** prevails due to geopolitical considerations. The **Rome Statute** and **Geneva Conventions** have provided a legal framework for potential prosecutions, yet **great power interests** have prevented enforcement. **Transitional justice** processes have been limited, failing to provide redress for victims of both international and domestic actors."
