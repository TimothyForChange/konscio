  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since the US withdrawal and Taliban takeover in August 2021, Afghanistan endures widespread suffering driven by **economic collapse** and the dismantling of public services. This deep humanitarian emergency results directly from the freezing of central bank assets and broad financial restrictions imposed by Western powers, isolating the country and crippling its ability to function. Millions face acute food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nThese **external economic pressures** â€” including the freezing of $7 billion in sovereign reserves â€” function as a form of **collective punishment**, drastically reducing state capacity and access to imports, with devastating consequences. The situation reverses fragile, **aid-dependent** development gains and fuels mass displacement and poverty.\n\nThe suffering is not merely an outcome of internal politics but is actively sustained by **international economic warfare**: **asset freezes**, **sanctions**, and financial exclusion have direct, measurable impacts. Addressing the crisis requires challenging these external **coercive measures**.",

    "legacy": "Afghanistan's fragility is embedded in a long history of **foreign intervention**. The 19th century '**Great Game**' between empires reshaped politics. **Soviet intervention** (1979-1989) and **Cold War proxy struggles** precipitated conflict and **state collapse**. The **US intervention** after 2001 created a hollow, **aid-dependent rentier state**. This project was fundamentally **neoliberal**, prioritising **privatisation**, outsourcing to **foreign contractors**, and imposing a market model fuelling corruption.\n\nEach intervention reshaped institutions, entrenching **dependency** and fragmenting governance. Repeated external remaking has been a **structural driver** of instability."
