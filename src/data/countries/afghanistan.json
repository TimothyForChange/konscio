  "currentCrisisSummary": "Following the US withdrawal and Taliban takeover in 2021, Afghanistan has been plunged into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The crisis is a direct result of international economic warfare, including the freezing of Afghanistan's central bank assets and broad sanctions. These policies have intentionally crippled the economy, precipitating the collapse of the healthcare system and fuelling widespread famine [UNDP, 2023]. This has erased two decades of fragile gains, which were built on a neo-colonial, aid-dependent model designed to enrich foreign contractors and a small domestic elite rather than foster genuine Afghan sovereignty. Women and girls now face systematic oppression under what human rights experts have defined as gender apartheid [UN Special Rapporteur, 2023; Amnesty International, 2023].",

    "legacy": "Afghanistan's crisis is rooted in a centuries-long history of imperial intervention that has consistently destabilised the region to serve external geopolitical and economic interests. The 19th-century 'Great Game' saw the British and Russian Empires compete for hegemony over Afghan territory, establishing a pattern of foreign interference that undermined local political development. This rivalry intensified during the Cold War, as the US and USSR turned Afghanistan into a proxy battleground. The CIA's Operation Cyclone, which armed and funded the Mujahideen to fight the Soviets, had the long-term consequence of fostering radical militancy and contributing to the fragmentation of the Afghan state. This continuous imperial meddling has created a cycle of instability that external powers continue to exploit for geopolitical leverage and control over regional resources."

  "coreTerms": {
    "theGraveyardOfEmpiresMyth": "This imperial-era moniker is a self-serving myth. It frames Afghanistan as an inherently ungovernable land, obscuring the reality that foreign intervention is a primary driver of its instability. Each major invasionâ€”British, Soviet, Americanâ€”sought to reorder Afghan society to serve external interests. These interventions consistently weakened or destroyed local institutions, fractured social cohesion, and fuelled resistance. The resulting instability is then cited by external powers as evidence of Afghan 'backwardness'â€”an orientalist narrative that deflects responsibility from their own destructive role.",
    "humanitarianBlackmailAndEconomicWarfare": "The current humanitarian crisis is not an accident but the deliberate consequence of political and economic decisions. Following the 2021 withdrawal, the US and its allies weaponised the international financial system. By freezing $7 billion of Afghanistan's sovereign wealth and enforcing a punitive sanctions regime, they have effectively cut the country off from the global economy. This constitutes a form of collective punishment against an entire population, inflicting immense suffering on millions of ordinary Afghans who now face famine and a collapsed health system. It is a textbook example of modern neo-imperialism, where economic coercion is used to enforce political compliance."
