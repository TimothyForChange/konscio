  "currentCrisisSummary": "Following the US withdrawal and Taliban takeover in 2021, Afghanistan has been plunged into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The situation has been exacerbated by international economic policies, including the freezing of Afghanistan's central bank assets and broad sanctions. These policies have severely impacted the economy, contributing to the collapse of the healthcare system and widespread famine. This has reversed two decades of fragile gains, which were built on an aid-dependent model that struggled to foster sustainable development. Women and girls now face systematic oppression and gender apartheid.",

    "legacy": "Afghanistan's stability has been impacted by a long history of foreign intervention. The 19th-century 'Great Game' saw the British and Russian Empires compete for influence over Afghan territory, establishing a pattern of foreign interference that often undermined local political development. This rivalry intensified during the Cold War, as the US and USSR turned Afghanistan into a proxy battleground. The CIA's Operation Cyclone, which armed and funded the Mujahideen to fight the Soviets, had the long-term consequence of fostering militancy and contributing to the fragmentation of the Afghan state. This continuous foreign involvement has created a cycle of instability that external powers have sometimes used for geopolitical leverage and to control regional resources."

  "coreTerms": {
    "theGraveyardOfEmpiresMyth": "This historical moniker is often described as a narrative that frames Afghanistan as an inherently ungovernable land. Critics argue this view can obscure the role of foreign intervention as a primary driver of instability. Each major invasionâ€”British, Soviet, Americanâ€”sought to reorder Afghan society to serve external interests. These interventions often weakened or destroyed local institutions, fractured social cohesion, and fuelled resistance. The resulting instability has sometimes been cited by external powers as evidence of internal failings, a narrative that critics argue deflects responsibility from the impact of foreign involvement.",
    "economicPressureAndSanctions": "The current humanitarian crisis is widely seen as a direct consequence of political and economic decisions. Following the 2021 withdrawal, the US and its allies utilised the international financial system to exert pressure. By freezing $7 billion of Afghanistan's sovereign wealth and enforcing a broad sanctions regime, they have effectively isolated the country from the global economy. Critics argue this constitutes a form of collective punishment against an entire population, inflicting immense suffering on millions of ordinary Afghans who now face famine and a collapsed health system. Some analysts describe this as a form of modern economic coercion used to achieve political objectives."
