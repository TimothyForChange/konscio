  "currentCrisisSummary": "South Sudan is gripped by a humanitarian emergency, fuelled by an elite conflict over the profits of a violent oil-extraction industry, catastrophic climate-driven flooding, and spillover from Sudan's war. These converging crises, driven by a system of kleptocracy, have left most of the population dependent on aid and facing one of the world's most severe hunger crises.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "Britain's 'Southern Policy' was a divide-and-rule strategy that sealed the south off from the 'Arab' north, deliberately blocking its economic and political development. This engineered disparity created a foundation of extreme inequality that made decades of civil war almost inevitable. This weakness also ensured that any future independent state would be highly vulnerable to foreign influence and resource exploitation."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "kleptocracyAndTheGlobalFinancialSystem": "The civil war is a violent struggle between political elites for control of the state, which functions primarily as a mechanism for diverting oil revenues. This system of kleptocracy is enabled by the global financial system; the ruling class uses international banks, shell companies, and the global luxury property market to launder and hide billions in stolen wealth, often using the conflict itself as a cover [The Sentry, 2019].",
    "oilConflictAndClimateChallenges": "South Sudan's crisis is driven by two forms of extraction. Firstly, its oil industry, operated by foreign corporations (primarily Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian) in partnership with the ruling elite, directly funds the conflict. Secondly, the country suffers from extreme climate injustice. Unprecedented flooding, caused by the emissions of the industrialised Global North, has destroyed livelihoods and acts as a conflict multiplier, intensifying competition over resources."

    "displaced": "Over 4 million people are displaced within South Sudan and as refugees, including over 2 million internally displaced by conflict and flooding [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "refugees": "More than 2.3 million refugees and asylum-seekers have fled to neighbouring countries, making it Africa's largest refugee crisis [UNHCR, 2025].",
    "casualties": "A 2018 study estimated that nearly 400,000 excess deaths were attributable to the civil war between 2013 and 2018 [LSHTM, 2018].",
    "affected": "An estimated 9 million peopleâ€”around 75% of the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian assistance [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 2.8 million children are out of school, one of the highest rates in the world, due to conflict, climate shocks, and displacement [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "poverty": "More than 80% of the population lives in extreme poverty, making South Sudan one of the poorest countries globally [World Bank, 2024]."
