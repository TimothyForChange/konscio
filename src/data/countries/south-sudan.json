  "currentCrisisSummary": "South Sudan suffers a severe humanitarian emergency driven by **elite competition over oil revenues**, recurrent **climate catastrophe** (flooding), and spillover from Sudan's war. The state, designed through a flawed **neoliberal peace process**, functions as a battlefield for **oil rents**, facilitated by a complicit **global financial system**.\n\nSimultaneously, **climate extremes** destroy livelihoods, multiplying displacement and hunger. The post-2013 conflict dynamics, rooted in this **predatory political economy**, inflict high mortality. Renewed tensions threaten fragile gains.\n\nThe human cost is immense, one of Africa's largest displacement crises. Solutions require dismantling **elite impunity**, ensuring **accountability**, and redirecting **oil wealth** and **international finance** (enabling **kleptocracy**) toward **locally-led recovery** and **climate resilience**.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Britain & Egypt (1899-1956)",

This **divide-and-rule** approach limited investment, leaving a legacy of **structural marginalisation** contributing to insurgency.\n\nThe administrative boundaries, uneven development, and **externally mediated leadership** created conditions vulnerable to **elite predation** and **resource-capture** post-independence."

It prioritised a **market-based, oil-exporting state**, focusing on technocratic elements. This model neglected grassroots reconciliation, failed to diversify the economy, and created a **hollow state** solely for distributing **oil rents**. The 2013 civil war was a predictable outcome of this flawed, **externally-imposed model**."

The state captures **rents** rather than delivering services. **International banks**, **opaque corporate structures**, and the **global financial system** enable laundering stolen wealth, allowing elites profit while services collapse.
