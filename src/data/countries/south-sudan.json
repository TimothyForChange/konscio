  "currentCrisisSummary": "South Sudan suffers a severe humanitarian emergency driven by **elite competition over oil revenues**, recurrent **climate catastrophe** (flooding), and spillover from Sudan's war. The state, designed through a flawed **neoliberal peace process**, functions as a battlefield for **oil rents**, facilitated by a complicit **global financial system**.\n\nSimultaneously, **climate extremes** destroy livelihoods, multiplying displacement and hunger. The post-2013 conflict dynamics, rooted in this **predatory political economy**, inflict high mortality and protection crises. Renewed tensions threaten fragile gains.\n\nThe human cost is immense, representing one of Africa's largest displacement crises. Durable solutions require dismantling **elite impunity**, ensuring **accountability**, and redirecting **oil wealth** and **international finance** (currently enabling **kleptocracy**) toward locally-led recovery and **climate resilience**.",

This **divide-and-rule** approach limited investment, leaving a legacy of **structural marginalisation** contributing to insurgency and weak governance.\n\nThe administrative boundaries, uneven development, and **externally mediated leadership** created conditions vulnerable to **elite predation** and **resource-capture** after independence."

      "title": "Neoliberal State-Building and the CPA",
      "description": "The 2005 **Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)**, mediated by **Western powers**, was a fundamentally **neoliberal peace-building project**. The international community prioritised a **market-based, oil-exporting state**, focusing on technocratic elements. This model neglected grassroots reconciliation and failed to build a diversified economy. It created a **hollow state** whose sole purpose was distributing **oil rents**, making state control the only prize. The 2013 civil war was a predictable outcome of this flawed, **externally-imposed model**."

The state functions as an apparatus for capturing **rents**. **International banks**, **opaque corporate structures**, and the **global financial system** enable laundering stolen wealth, permitting elites to profit while services collapse. This is an active feature of a **global financial system** providing **safe havens for illicit capital**, directly fuelling conflict. **Financial opacity** and weak due diligence are **structural enablers**."
