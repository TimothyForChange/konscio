  "currentCrisisSummary": "South Sudan is gripped by a humanitarian emergency, fuelled by a kleptocratic elite conflict, catastrophic climate-driven flooding, and spillover from Sudan's war. These converging crises have left most of the population dependent on aid and facing one of the world's most severe hunger crises [UN OCHA, 2024].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "Britain's colonial administration implemented the 'Southern Policy', a divide-and-rule strategy that treated the south as a separate, 'African' entity to be sealed off from the 'Arab' north [Douglas H. Johnson, 2011]. This policy deliberately blocked economic and educational development, barred northern Sudanese from the region, and aimed to stop the spread of Islam. While the north was modernised, the south was systematically underdeveloped and isolated. This engineered disparity created a foundation of extreme inequality, ensuring that upon independence, the South would be entirely subordinate to Khartoum, making decades of civil war almost inevitable."

  "coreTerms": {
    "kleptocracyAndEliteConflict": "The civil war is not primarily an ethnic conflict but a violent struggle between a predatory elite fighting for control over the state's vast oil revenues. The state itself functions as a kleptocracyâ€”a system of rule by theftâ€”where resources are systematically looted to fund personal militias and patronage networks. The government has become an engine of extraction that fuels the conflict for the personal enrichment of its leaders [UN Panel of Experts on South Sudan, 2024].",
    "climateInjusticeAndConflict": "South Sudan is on the front line of climate injustice, suffering catastrophic consequences from a crisis it did almost nothing to create. Years of unprecedented flooding have submerged entire regions, destroying livelihoods and displacing hundreds of thousands [FEWS NET, 2024]. This ecological collapse acts as a conflict multiplier, intensifying competition over scarce resources and driving cycles of intercommunal violence that are exploited by political elites."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 2 million people are internally displaced by conflict and flooding [IOM, 2024].",
    "refugees": "More than 2.2 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, primarily Uganda, Sudan, and Ethiopia, making it Africa's largest refugee crisis [UNHCR, 2024].",
    "casualties": "A 2018 study estimated that nearly 400,000 excess deaths were attributable to the civil war since 2013 [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine study, 2018].",
    "affected": "9 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance. 7.1 million face crisis levels of hunger, with parts of the country facing a man-made risk of famine driven by conflict and the obstruction of aid [UN OCHA; IPC, 2024]."
