  "currentCrisisSummary": "South Sudan is facing a humanitarian emergency, fuelled by an elite conflict over oil revenues, severe climate-driven flooding, and spillover from Sudan's war. These converging crises, driven by a system of widespread corruption, have left most of the population dependent on aid and facing one of the world's most severe hunger crises.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (British Rule, 1899-1956)",
    "legacy": "Britain's 'Southern Policy' was a divide-and-rule strategy that administered the south separately from the north, hindering its economic and political development. This created a foundation of inequality that contributed to decades of civil war. This weakness also ensured that a future independent state would be vulnerable to foreign influence and resource exploitation."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "corruptionAndTheGlobalFinancialSystem": "The civil war is a struggle between political elites for control of the state, which functions primarily as a mechanism for diverting oil revenues. This system of corruption is not just a local problem; it is enabled by the global financial system. The opacity of international banking, shell companies, and luxury property markets allows the ruling class to launder and hide billions in stolen wealth, often using the conflict as a cover [The Sentry, 2019].",
    "oilConflictAndClimateChallenges": "South Sudan's crisis is driven by two main factors. Firstly, its oil industry, operated by foreign corporations (primarily Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian) in partnership with the ruling elite, has been criticized for privatising profits while the costs of environmental damage and conflict are borne by the civilian population. Secondly, the country suffers from the severe impacts of climate change. Unprecedented flooding, linked to the emissions of the industrialised Global North, has destroyed livelihoods and acts as a conflict multiplier."

    "casualties": "A 2018 study estimated that nearly 400,000 excess deaths were attributable to the civil war between 2013 and 2018 [LSHTM, 2018].",
    "affected": "An estimated 9 million peopleâ€”around 75% of the populationâ€”require urgent humanitarian assistance [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 2.8 million children are out of school, one of the highest rates in the world, due to conflict, climate shocks, and displacement [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "poverty": "More than 80% of the population lives in extreme poverty, making South Sudan one of the poorest countries globally [World Bank, 2024]."
