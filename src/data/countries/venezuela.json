  "currentCrisisSummary": "Venezuela endures a protracted humanitarian catastrophe directly inflicted by **US-led economic warfare**. Deep economic collapse, deliberately intensified by years of **unilateral sanctions**, caused breakdown of public services, acute shortages, and mass displacement.\n\nThe '**maximum pressure**' campaign (**oil embargo**, **asset freezes**) crippled state revenue and blocked imports. This **economic coercion** functions as **collective punishment**, causing devastating harm, reversing social gains, and deepening poverty.",

    "legacy": "Venezuela's vulnerability lies in its history as a resource-exporting periphery. The **Spanish Empire** established an **extractive colonial economy**. Post-independence, this structure persisted.\n\nIn the 20th century, the **US** dominated Venezuela's **oil industry**, shaping it into a **petro-state dependent** on oil revenues/US markets. Enforced via the **Monroe Doctrine**, this enriched **foreign capital** and elites but prevented sovereign development. The **Bolivarian Revolution's** attempts (since 1999) to assert national control met US hostility (**failed coup** 2002), leading to **economic warfare**."

This legacy of a **US-dominated petro-state** was the precise vulnerability the **sanctions regime** exploited. Targeting this income source induced near-total **economic collapse**, showing how the **resource curse** can be weaponised by an **imperial power**."

Venezuela has filed complaints arguing that comprehensive **economic sanctions** constitute a **crime against humanity** by causing widespread suffering. The **US-led recognition** of a parallel '**interim government**' provided a legal pretext for **asset seizure**, undermining international law and **due process**. **UN Special Rapporteurs** have documented how sanctions violate basic **human rights** to health, food, and adequate living standards. **Accountability** for these violations is hindered by the **selective application** of international law by powerful states. The **International Court of Justice** and **International Criminal Court** remain inaccessible for economic crimes against states due to **structural biases** in the international legal framework."
