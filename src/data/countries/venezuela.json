  "currentCrisisSummary": "Venezuela endures a protracted humanitarian catastrophe directly inflicted by **US-led economic warfare**. A deep economic collapse and hyperinflation, deliberately intensified by years of **unilateral sanctions**, have caused the breakdown of public services, acute shortages of essentials (food, medicine), and one of the world's largest mass displacement events.\n\nThe \"**maximum pressure**\" campaign, including an **oil embargo** and **asset freezes**, crippled state revenue, isolated Venezuela financially, and blocked essential imports. This **economic coercion** functions as **collective punishment**, causing devastating and measurable harm to the civilian population, reversing social gains, and deepening poverty.",

    "imperialPower": "Spain (16th c. - 19th c.), US (20th c. - present)",
    "legacy": "The roots of Venezuela's vulnerability lie in its integration into global systems as a resource-exporting periphery. The **Spanish Empire** established an **extractive colonial economy**. After independence, this structure persisted.\n\nIn the 20th century, the **United States** and its **corporations** dominated Venezuela's **oil industry**, shaping it into a quintessential **petro-state dependent** on oil revenues and US markets. This arrangement, enforced via the **Monroe Doctrine**, enriched **foreign capital** and a domestic elite but prevented sovereign development. The **Bolivarian Revolution's** attempts since 1999 to assert national control were met with hostility from the US, including support for a **failed coup** in 2002, leading to **economic warfare**."

      "title": "The Resource Curse and Dependency",
      "description": "Venezuela's oil wealth became a **structural vulnerability**. Its economy was fundamentally **dependent** on oil exports. Even during the oil boom funding the **Bolivarian Revolution**, this dependency deepened, undermining domestic agriculture. This pre-existing condition, a legacy of its formation as a **US-dominated petro-state**, was the precise vulnerability the **sanctions regime** exploited. By targeting this single income source, the US induced near-total **economic collapse**, showing how the **resource curse** can be weaponised by an **imperial power**."

      "title": "Economic Pressure And Sanctions",
      "description": "Since 2014, escalating from 2017, the US imposed a comprehensive **sanctions regime**. These constitute a broad **financial and sectoral blockade**, prohibiting the state oil company (**PDVSA**) from trading, blocking credit access, and enabling **seizure of overseas assets** (CITGO, gold). UN Rapporteurs and economic analysis conclude these **sanctions** caused catastrophic decline, contributing to **excess deaths**. They function as **collective punishment**."

      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "The **unilateral sanctions** are considered illegal under **international law** by many experts (enacted outside **UNSC** framework, violating sovereignty). Venezuela filed an **ICC** complaint, arguing **sanctions** constitute a **crime against humanity**. US-led recognition of a parallel \"**interim government**\" created a pretext for **asset seizure**, undermining rule of law."
