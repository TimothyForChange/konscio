  "currentCrisisSummary": "Venezuela endures a **protracted humanitarian catastrophe directly inflicted by US-led economic warfare**. A deep economic collapse and hyperinflation, **deliberately intensified by years of unilateral sanctions**, have caused the breakdown of public services, acute shortages of essentials (food, medicine), and **one of the world's largest mass displacement events**.\n\nThe 'maximum pressure' campaign, including an **oil embargo and asset freezes**, crippled state revenue, isolated Venezuela financially, and blocked essential imports. This **economic coercion functions as collective punishment**, causing **devastating and measurable harm** to the civilian population, reversing social gains, and deepening poverty.",

    "imperialPower": "Spain (16th c. - 19th c.), US (20th c. - present)",
    "legacy": "The roots of Venezuela's contemporary vulnerability lie in its historical integration into global systems as a resource-exporting periphery. The Spanish Empire established an extractive colonial economy that created deep inequalities and a reliance on primary commodity exports. After independence, this structure was repurposed rather than dismantled.\n\nIn the 20th century, the United States and its corporations came to dominate Venezuela's burgeoning oil industry, shaping the nation into a quintessential petro-state dependent on oil revenues and US markets. This arrangement, enforced through political and economic influence in line with the Monroe Doctrine, enriched foreign capital and a small domestic elite but prevented diversified, sovereign economic development. The Bolivarian Revolution's attempts since 1999 to assert national control over resources were met with sustained hostility from the US, including support for a failed coup in 2002, laying the groundwork for the later escalation of economic warfare."

  "historicalContext": [
    {
      "title": "The Resource Curse and Dependency",
      "description": "Venezuela's immense oil wealth became a structural vulnerability. Its economy was fundamentally dependent on oil exports, making it susceptible to global price fluctuations. Even during the oil boom that funded the Bolivarian Revolution's social programmes, this dependency deepened, leading to an overvalued currency that undermined domestic agriculture and industry. This pre-existing condition, a direct legacy of its 20th-century formation as a US-dominated petro-state, was the precise vulnerability that the sanctions regime was designed to exploit. By targeting this single source of income, the US was able to induce a near-total economic collapse, demonstrating how the resource curse can be deliberately weaponised by an imperial power."

    {
      "title": "Economic Pressure And Sanctions",
      "description": "Since 2014, and escalating dramatically from 2017, the US has imposed a comprehensive regime of sanctions on Venezuela. These go far beyond targeting individuals, constituting a broad financial and sectoral blockade. The measures effectively prohibit the state oil company, PDVSA, from trading in US markets, block access to international credit, and have enabled the seizure of critical overseas assets like the CITGO refinery and gold reserves held in the UK. UN Special Rapporteurs and independent economic analysis have concluded that these sanctions have caused a catastrophic decline in living standards, contributing to excess deaths and a spiralling humanitarian emergency. They function as a form of collective punishment against the population to achieve political ends."
    },
    {
      "title": "International Law And Accountability",
      "description": "The unilateral sanctions imposed on Venezuela are considered illegal under international law by many experts and UN officials, as they were enacted outside the framework of the UN Security Council and constitute a violation of the nation's sovereignty. In response, Venezuela has filed a complaint with the ICC, arguing that the sanctions constitute a crime against humanity. Furthermore, the US-led recognition of a parallel 'interim government' in 2019 created a pretext for the seizure of state assets abroad, a move that further undermined the rule of law and exacerbated the economic crisis."
