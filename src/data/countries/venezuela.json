  "currentCrisisSummary": "Venezuela is enduring a complex humanitarian emergency driven by a catastrophic economic collapse, political polarisation, and crippling external sanctions. The implosion of the state has destroyed public services, triggered hyperinflation, and created one of the largest migrant and refugee crises in the world, leaving millions unable to access food or healthcare [UN OCHA, 2025].",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Spanish Empire",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in the colonial-era extractive model established by Spain. At independence, Venezuela inherited a non-industrialised, commodity-dependent economy. The 20th-century discovery of oil did not break this neocolonial pattern but intensified it, transforming Venezuela into a quintessential 'petro-state' [Fernando Coronil, 'The Magical State', 1997]. The entire national economy became dependent on oil exports, creating extreme vulnerability to global price shocks and fostering a political culture of corruption and patronage, while preventing the development of a diversified, resilient economic base."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "theOilCurseAndPetroStateCollapse": "Venezuela's immense oil wealth became a curse. It created a 'petro-state' where politics was reduced to a battle for control over oil revenues. When oil prices were high, the state could maintain a social contract; when they collapsed in the 2010s, the entire system imploded. The current crisis is not a failure of one ideology, but the predictable, catastrophic failure of the neocolonial petro-state model itself, a structure that is inherently unstable and unsustainable.",
    "hybridWarfareAndCoerciveMeasures": "While internal factors triggered the crisis, its severity has been deliberately and massively amplified by the United States' policy of 'maximum pressure'. Crippling economic sanctions imposed since 2017 function as a form of hybrid warfare, targeting the entire economy to achieve regime change. These coercive measures have blocked the country's access to international financial markets, prevented the import of food, medicine, and essential equipment, and are directly responsible for tens of thousands of civilian deaths, constituting a form of collective punishment [CEPR, 2019]."
  },
  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "Over 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country, creating the largest refugee and migrant crisis in the recent history of the Americas [R4V Platform, 2025].",
    "refugees": "The vast majority of those who have fled remain in Latin American and Caribbean countries, placing immense strain on the region.",
    "casualties": "While conflict casualties are low compared to other crises, excess mortality from the collapse of the health system and malnutrition is vast. US sanctions were estimated to have caused more than 40,000 deaths between 2017-2018 alone [CEPR, 2019].",
    "affected": "An estimated 19 million people inside Venezuela have urgent humanitarian needs, with the healthcare system in a state of collapse and millions facing severe food insecurity [Humanitarian Response Plan, 2025]."
