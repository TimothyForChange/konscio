  "currentCrisisSummary": "Venezuela endures a protracted humanitarian catastrophe driven by the disastrous interaction of **US-led economic warfare** and **catastrophic internal state failure**. Deep economic collapse‚Äîcaused by **state mismanagement, corruption, authoritarianism**, and then deliberately intensified by **unilateral US sanctions**‚Äîhas shattered public services, caused acute shortages, and fuelled mass displacement.\n\nThe '**maximum pressure**' campaign (**oil embargo**, **asset freezes**) crippled state revenue, amplifying the damage already inflicted by internal policy failures. This combination of **external coercion** and **internal decay** functions as **collective punishment**, reversing social gains and deepening poverty.",

    "legacy": "Venezuela's vulnerability lies in its history as a resource-exporting periphery. The **Spanish Empire** established an **extractive colonial economy**. Post-independence, **US** corporations dominated Venezuela's **oil industry**, shaping it into a **petro-state dependent** on oil revenues/US markets.\n\nThis enriched **foreign capital** and local elites but prevented sovereign development. The **Bolivarian Revolution's** attempts (since 1999) to assert national control were met with US hostility (**failed coup** 2002) but also suffered from profound **internal mismanagement**, ultimately leading to **US economic warfare** and state collapse."

      "title": "The Resource Curse and Dependency",
      "description": "Oil wealth was a **structural vulnerability**. The economy was fundamentally **dependent** on oil exports, a legacy of **US domination** deepened by Bolivarian policies. This dependency was the precise weakness **US sanctions** exploited. Targeting oil income *after* internal mismanagement had already crippled production induced near-total **economic collapse**."

      "title": "Internal Economic Mismanagement",
      "description": "Long before the harshest US sanctions (2017), the Venezuelan state pursued **disastrous economic policies**. This included **unsustainable price and currency controls** generating shortages and black markets; **systematic expropriations** destroying the private sector; **rampant mismanagement and corruption within the state oil company (PDVSA)** causing production collapse; and **reckless fiscal spending** leading to hyperinflation *before* the US oil embargo."

      "title": "State Authoritarianism and Repression",
      "description": "Parallel to the economic decline, the state under Ch√°vez and Maduro became increasingly **authoritarian**. This involved the **systematic dismantling of democratic institutions** (judiciary, electoral council, legislature), **persecution of political opponents**, **censorship** of independent media, and **brutal state violence** against protesters. The **highly contested 2018 election** deepened the legitimacy crisis, providing a pretext for further US intervention."

      "title": "State Corruption",
      "description": "The Bolivarian era fostered **endemic state corruption** on a massive scale. Billions of dollars in oil revenues were siphoned off through opaque **currency exchange systems**, **embezzlement within PDVSA**, and **patronage networks**. This **kleptocracy** crippled public services, destroyed state capacity, and fuelled popular anger, contributing significantly to the economic collapse."

Venezuela has filed complaints arguing they constitute a **crime against humanity**. The **US-led recognition** of a parallel '**interim government**' provided a legal pretext for **asset seizure**, undermining international law. **UN Special Rapporteurs** have documented how sanctions violate basic **human rights**. **Accountability** for these violations is hindered by the **selective application** of international law by powerful states."
