  "currentCrisisSummary": "Haiti endures a catastrophic **collapse of governance and society**, directly driven by centuries of **foreign intervention**, **economic extraction**, and **elite impunity**. A near-total implosion of state functions allows armed gangsâ€”often linked to elitesâ€”to control vast areas, imposing extortion, mass violence, and displacement. Humanitarian access is blocked by insecurity, producing acute hunger.\n\nAn internationally backed, Kenyan-led mission faces constraints and contested legitimacy. The crisis is rooted in **colonial expropriation**, **odious debt enforced by France**, repeated **US occupations**, and **neoliberal policies** that deliberately undermined Haitian agriculture and sovereignty, leaving the population extremely vulnerable.",

In 1825 France imposed an **indemnity** ('compensation' for slaveholders). Financed by foreign loans, it drained resources and entrenched **dependency** â€” a key example of **post-colonial debt** perpetuating **extraction**."
