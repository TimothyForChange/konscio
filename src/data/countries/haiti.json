  "currentCrisisSummary": "Haiti is facing a severe humanitarian emergency, driven by a near-total collapse of state functions. This is the result of centuries of foreign intervention and economic extraction that have undermined the country's development. A power vacuum has allowed heavily armed groups, often with ties to the country's political and economic elite, to seize control of the capital, Port-au-Prince, unleashing extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (1697-1804)",
    "legacy": "The roots of the crisis lie in the international reaction to Haiti's successful revolution (1791-1804). The world's first Black republic was diplomatically isolated and economically pressured.\n\nIn 1825, under the threat of military invasion, France imposed a significant 'indemnity' on Haiti to compensate former slaveholders. This indemnity, financed through French banks, is an example of post-colonial economic pressure: it forced the new nation to pay for its freedom, creating a cycle of debt that drained the state's wealth for over a century and undermined its development from the very beginning."
  },
  "historicalContext": {
    "postColonialDebtAndExtraction": "The 1825 indemnity established a model of post-colonial control through debt. By forcing Haiti to pay its former colonisers a sum estimated to be worth over $21 billion today, France placed the new nation in a state of financial dependency. This policy contributed to chronic underdevelopment, creating a cycle of foreign debt and external control that has shaped Haiti's entire history, ensuring wealth flowed out of the country rather than being invested in its people.",
    "foreignInterventionAndOccupation": "Subsequent foreign interventions have consistently undermined Haitian sovereignty. During the US occupation (1915-1934), US Marines transferred Haiti's gold reserves to New York banks and rewrote the constitution to permit foreign land ownership. More recent interventions have promoted economic policies associated with the 'Washington Consensus', such as slashing tariffs on imported US rice, which damaged local agriculture, created food dependency, and privatised state assets, often benefiting foreign capital. These actions weakened Haitian-led institutions, a process compounded by the introduction of a deadly cholera epidemic by UN peacekeepers in 2010."

    "affected": "An estimated 5.5 million peopleâ€”nearly half the populationâ€”require humanitarian assistance to survive.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over half a million children are out of school in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area alone due to insecurity.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "The healthcare system is on the verge of collapse, with many facilities closed or inaccessible due to violence and shortages.",
    "foodInsecurity": "Nearly 5 million people face acute food insecurity, with over 1.6 million at emergency levels.",
    "lackOfWaterAccess": "More than one-third of the population lacks access to basic drinking water services."
