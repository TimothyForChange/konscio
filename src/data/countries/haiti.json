  "currentCrisisSummary": "Haiti is experiencing a severe, multi-dimensional humanitarian and governance collapse driven by decades of foreign intervention, economic extraction and chronic elite capture.\n\nA near-total collapse of state functions has allowed heavily armed gangs â€” often with ties to political and economic elites â€” to seize control of large parts of Port-au-Prince and other urban centres, imposing extortion, mass violence and mass displacement. Humanitarian access is constrained by insecurity, blockades and attacks on health and aid infrastructure, producing acute food insecurity, rising mortality and a rapidly expanding population of internally displaced people.\n\nAn internationally backed, Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission has deployed to assist the Haitian National Police, but the mission remains heavily understaffed and constrained by funding, logistics and contested legitimacy. The crisis is rooted in a long history of colonial expropriation, odious debt and intrusive foreign policy, and is compounded by years of policy choices that undermined local agriculture, public services and sovereign development.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (1697-1804)",
    "legacy": "Haiti's modern fragility traces back to the international reaction to the Haitian Revolution. The world's first Black republic was diplomatically isolated, economically pressured and forced to buy recognition.\n\nIn 1825 France imposed an indemnity on Haiti to 'compensate' former slaveholders. Financed through foreign loans and paid over generations, the indemnity drained the new state's resources and entrenched dependency â€” a formative example of how post-colonial debt has been used to perpetuate extraction and limit sovereign development."
  },
  "historicalContext": {
    "postColonialDebtAndExtraction": "The 1825 indemnity established a pattern of external economic control that shaped Haiti's fiscal and development trajectory. Successive loans, debt-servicing obligations and mercantilist trade pressures channelled wealth outwards rather than funding broad-based investment, undermining agricultural resilience, infrastructure and state capacity.\n\nThese structural pressures were reinforced across the 19th and 20th centuries by discriminatory trade policies, foreign business interests and conditional financial relations that favoured foreign capital over local development.",
    "foreignInterventionAndOccupation": "Foreign interventions have repeatedly undermined Haitian sovereignty. The US occupation (1915-1934) centralised fiscal control, moved gold reserves offshore and rewrote key legal frameworks to favour foreign interests. Later international economic prescriptions â€” tariff liberalisation, privatisation and donor-driven policy conditionalities â€” weakened domestic agriculture and industry, increasing dependence on imports and external aid.\n\nInternational actors have also played direct political roles, including support for coups and pressure on elected governments, leaving Haiti with chronically weakened institutions and limited capacity to manage recurrent shocks.",
    "publicHealthAndUNRESPONSIBILITY": "International presence has also inflicted direct harm: UN peacekeepers inadvertently introduced a cholera epidemic in 2010 that caused thousands of deaths and provoked a protracted public health disaster for which the UN has since acknowledged responsibility. This episode deepened mistrust of international actors and highlighted the risks of poorly governed external interventions.",
    "internationalLawAndAccountability": "There are multiple accountability threads â€” historical (the 1825 indemnity and colonial expropriation), transitional (investigations into the 2021 assassination of President MoÃ¯se), and contemporaneous (documentation of human-rights abuses by gangs and by public actors). Formal international responses, including human-rights monitoring and UN Security Council authorisations for multilateral missions, exist but face political contestation and remain insufficient to meet victims' demands for justice and reparations."

  "humanitarianImpact": {
    "displaced": "More than 1.3 million people are internally displaced (a record high as of mid-2025), with displacement driven by gang sieges, extortion and repeated attacks on civilian areas.",
    "refugees": "Hundreds of thousands of Haitians have fled the country in recent years, and many more face deportation or forced returns that further strain local coping mechanisms and regional systems.",
    "casualties": "Violence levels have surged. The first quarter of 2024 saw around 2,500 people killed or injured in gang violence, and UN reporting recorded more than 5,600 people killed across 2024 as gangs escalated their attacks, kidnappings and reprisals.",
    "affected": "Approximately 5.5-6.0 million people â€” roughly half the population â€” require humanitarian assistance, driven by food insecurity, protection risks, WASH needs and healthcare collapse.",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Hundreds of thousands of children, particularly in Port-au-Prince and conflict-affected departments, are out of school because of insecurity, displacement and the closure of education facilities.",
    "healthSystemCollapsed": "A large share of health facilities in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere are non-functional or inaccessible due to attacks, staff flight and supply disruptions, producing severe gaps in essential care and epidemic control.",
    "foodInsecurity": "Acute food insecurity has reached crisis levels: recent IPC and WFP assessments identify roughly 5.7 million people facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with around 1.9 million at emergency levels of hunger.",
    "lackOfWaterAccess": "Millions lack reliable access to safe drinking water and sanitation, compounding malnutrition and infectious-disease risks and worsening the public-health emergency."
