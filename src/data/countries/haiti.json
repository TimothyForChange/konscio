  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (1697-1804)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is a direct result of Haiti's punishment for its successful slave revolt (1791-1804). After defeating Napoleon's army, the world's first Black republic was treated as a pariah state. In 1825, under threat of military invasion, France extorted a crippling 'indemnity' from Haiti as compensation for the 'loss' of enslaved people as property. This foundational act of racial capitalism forced Haiti to pay its former enslavers, creating a debt peonage that crippled the state for over a century, systematically draining its wealth and preventing any investment in public institutions [The New York Times, 'The Ransom', 2022]."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "neocolonialDebtAndExtraction": "France pioneered a new form of neocolonialism with the 1825 indemnity, ensuring Haiti's economic subjugation long after political independence. By forcing Haiti to pay its former colonisers the modern equivalent of over $21 billion, France deliberately engineered a state of permanent underdevelopment. This initial act of extraction created a cycle of debt dependency and foreign control that has defined Haiti's history.",
    "imperialInterventionAndOccupation": "From the US occupation (1915-1934) to a series of UN missions, repeated foreign interventions have systematically undermined Haitian sovereignty. These actions, often framed as 'stabilisation', have supported anti-democratic forces, imposed disastrous neoliberal economic policies, and created a culture of impunity (e.g., the UN's introduction of cholera [UN Special Rapporteur Report, 2016]). This legacy of foreign-imposed dependency has fostered chronic instability and prevented the emergence of resilient, Haitian-led institutions."
