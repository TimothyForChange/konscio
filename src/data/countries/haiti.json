  "currentCrisisSummary": "Haiti endures a catastrophic **collapse of governance and society**, driven by centuries of **foreign intervention**, **economic extraction**, and **elite impunity**. A near-total implosion of state functions allows armed gangs—funded by a **corrupt oligarchy** and empowered by the **'Core Group's'** political interference—to control vast areas, imposing extortion, mass violence, and displacement.\n\nAn internationally backed, Kenyan-led mission faces constraints and contested legitimacy. The crisis is rooted in **colonial expropriation**, **odious debt enforced by France**, repeated **US occupations**, and **neoliberal policies** that deliberately undermined Haitian sovereignty, leaving the population extremely vulnerable.",

    "legacy": "Haiti's fragility traces back to the international reaction to the **Haitian Revolution**. The world's first Black republic was isolated and pressured. In 1825 France imposed an **indemnity** ('compensation' for slaveholders). Financed by foreign loans, it drained resources and entrenched **dependency** — a key example of **post-colonial debt** perpetuating **extraction**."
