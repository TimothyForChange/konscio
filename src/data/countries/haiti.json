  "currentCrisisSummary": "Haiti is facing a catastrophic humanitarian emergency, driven by a near-total collapse of the state. A power vacuum has allowed heavily armed groups, often integrated with the country's political and economic elite, to seize control of the capital, Port-au-Prince, unleashing extreme violence and mass displacement.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (1697-1804)",
    "legacy": "The roots of the crisis lie in the international reaction to Haiti's successful slave revolt (1791-1804). The world's first Black republic was diplomatically isolated and economically targeted. In 1825, under the threat of military invasion, France imposed a crippling 'indemnity' on Haiti to compensate former slaveholders. This indemnity, financed through French banks, is a foundational example of racial capitalism: it forced a nation of formerly enslaved people to pay for their freedom, creating a cycle of debt that drained the state's wealth for over a century and undermined its development from the very beginning."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "neocolonialDebtAndExtraction": "The 1825 indemnity established a powerful model of neocolonial control through debt. By forcing Haiti to pay its former colonisers a sum estimated to be worth over $21 billion today [The New York Times, 2022], France locked the new nation into a state of financial dependency. This policy had the effect of engineering chronic underdevelopment, creating a cycle of foreign debt and external control that has shaped Haiti's entire history, ensuring wealth flowed out of the country rather than being invested in its people.",
    "imperialInterventionAndOccupation": "Subsequent foreign interventions have consistently undermined Haitian sovereignty. The US occupation (1915-1934) saw US Marines seize Haiti's gold reserves for New York banks and rewrite the constitution to permit foreign land ownership. More recent interventions have imposed neoliberal policies, such as slashing tariffs on imported US rice, which decimated local agriculture and created chronic food dependency. These actions have fostered instability and systematically weakened Haitian-led institutions, a process compounded by the UN's introduction of a deadly cholera epidemic in 2010 [UN, Alston Report, 2016]."

    "affected": "An estimated 5.5 million peopleâ€”nearly half the populationâ€”require humanitarian assistance to survive [UN OCHA, 2025].",
    "childrenOutOfSchool": "Over half a million children are out of school in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area alone due to insecurity [Education Cluster, 2024].",
