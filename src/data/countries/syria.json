  "currentCrisisSummary": "A brutal civil war since 2011, culminating in the collapse of the Ba'athist regime in 2024, has fuelled a severe humanitarian crisis. The conflict is marked by mass displacement, the fragmentation of the state, and the deep entanglement of foreign powers, including Russia, Iran, TÃ¼rkiye, and the United States.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, 1923-1946)",
    "legacy": "Ignoring Syrian calls for self-determination, France and Britain imposed a colonial Mandate rooted in the Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916). France enforced a 'divide and rule' strategy, fracturing Syria into sectarian statelets (e.g., the Alawite State, the Druze State) to weaken national identity and foster divisions that persist today [James L. Gelvin, 2021]. This policy, combined with exploitative economics and the establishment of a repressive state structure, left a legacy of instability and vulnerability to foreign intervention."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "weaponisedSectarianism": "The Mandate-era strategy of dividing the country along ethnic and religious lines deepened societal fractures. The Assad regime, and the foreign powers intervening in the civil war, systematically weaponised these inherited divisions, transforming a popular uprising against authoritarianism into a complex proxy war fought along sectarian lines.",
    "inheritedStateRepression": "The post-independence authoritarian regime preserved and perfected the repressive state structures of the French Mandate, creating a powerful 'Mukhabarat' (intelligence) state. This inherited framework of total control, unable to accommodate popular dissent, ultimately shattered under the pressure of the 2011 uprising, creating a power vacuum filled by warlords and foreign-backed militias."

    "displaced": "Over 7.2 million internally displaced (IDPs), one of the world's largest internal displacement crises [UNHCR/OCHA, 2024].",
    "refugees": "Over 5.2 million refugees, mostly in neighbouring TÃ¼rkiye, Lebanon, and Jordan, creating immense regional strain [UNHCR, 2024].",
    "casualties": "Over 350,000 confirmed civilian deaths, though the actual toll is estimated to be over 600,000. The war has also seen the systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools [UN Human Rights Office, 2022; SOHR, 2024].",
