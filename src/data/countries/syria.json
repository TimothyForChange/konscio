  "currentCrisisSummary": "Following the sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Dec 2024, Syria enters a fragile transition, remaining a **shattered state** enduring catastrophic suffering inflicted through years of war. A transitional government grapples with authority over a territory fractured by armed factions and **occupied by foreign powers** (Turkey, US, Russia).\n\nThe 2011 popular uprising was transformed into an **internationalised proxy war** by competing powers pursuing **geopolitical agendas**. This **external interference** fuelled violence, prolonged suffering, and caused the **collapse of state and society**. Millions are displaced, infrastructure ruined, and most depend on aid, leaving Syria vulnerable to new forms of **economic coercion** masked as reconstruction.",

France used '**divide-and-rule**' tactics, exacerbating sectarian tensions. This fragmented national identity and laid **structural foundations** for conflict.\n\nDuring the **Cold War**, Syria became a **client state** of the Soviet Union, entrenching an **authoritarian state structure** and setting the stage for intense **foreign interventions** after 2011."

Encouraged by the **IMF**/**World Bank**, Assad implemented **neoliberal 'reforms'**: dismantling subsidies, **privatising public assets**, opening to **foreign capital**. This enriched a **crony-capitalist class** while creating mass unemployment and poverty. Protests were partly a rebellion against this inequality."

This further fragmented the country, placed resources under **US-backed proxy forces**, adding another layer of **imperial entanglement**."
