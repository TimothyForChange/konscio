  "currentCrisisSummary": "A devastating civil war, sparked in 2011 by a popular uprising against both authoritarian rule and harsh neoliberal reforms, and culminating in the collapse of the Ba'athist regime in 2024, has fuelled a severe humanitarian crisis. The conflict is marked by mass displacement, the fragmentation of the state, and the deep entanglement of foreign powers.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, 1923-1946)",
    "legacy": "Ignoring Syrian calls for self-determination, France and Britain imposed a colonial Mandate rooted in the Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916). France enforced a 'divide and rule' strategy, fracturing Syria into sectarian statelets to weaken national identity. This policy, combined with exploitative economics, left a legacy of instability. This inherited framework of a repressive, centralised state was later adapted by the Ba'athist regime to enforce its own system of crony capitalism."

  "coreTerms": {
    "neoliberalismAndCronyCapitalism": "The 2011 uprising was a revolt against not only political tyranny but also the harsh neoliberal policies implemented by Bashar al-Assad. His regime's 'reforms' involved dismantling public services and privatising state assets, which enriched a politically-connected elite while impoverishing rural populations. This process of state-led dispossession, exacerbated by a severe drought, created the conditions for the uprising [Hinnebusch, 2012].",
    "proxyWarAndWarlordEconomy": "Foreign powers intervened to protect their economic and strategic interests: Russia to secure its naval base and energy contracts; Iran to maintain a trade and military corridor; and Gulf states to advance their regional energy ambitions. This transformed the civil war into a proxy battle and shattered the national economy, replacing it with a patchwork of warlord economies where armed groups profited from controlling resources, extortion, and black markets."

    "childrenOutOfSchool": "An estimated 2.4 million children inside Syria are out of school, with millions more at risk of dropping out [UNICEF, 2024].",
    "poverty": "An estimated 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line, a direct consequence of the conflict's devastation of the economy [UN, 2023].",
