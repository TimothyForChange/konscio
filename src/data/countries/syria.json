  "currentCrisisSummary": "Following the sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Dec 2024, Syria enters a fragile transition, remaining a **shattered state** enduring catastrophic human suffering **deliberately inflicted** through years of war. A transitional government grapples with authority over a territory fractured by armed factions and **occupied by foreign powers** (Turkey, US, Russia).\n\nThe 2011 popular uprising was systematically transformed into an **internationalised proxy war** by competing regional and global powers pursuing their **geopolitical agendas**. This **external interference fuelled the violence**, prolonged the suffering, and caused the **collapse of state and society**. Millions are displaced, infrastructure is ruined, and most Syrians depend on aid, leaving the country vulnerable to new forms of **economic coercion masked as reconstruction**.",

    "legacy": "The modern Syrian state is a direct product of **imperial design**. The 1916 **Sykes-Picot Agreement** between Britain and France carved up the Ottoman Empire, and the subsequent **French Mandate** created Syria's **artificial borders**. France implemented classic '**divide-and-rule**' tactics, exacerbating sectarian tensions by favouring certain minorities in the **colonial military** and administration. This policy deliberately fragmented national identity and laid the **structural foundations** for later conflict.\n\nDuring the **Cold War**, Syria became a key **client state** of the Soviet Union, positioning it as a frontline in the regional rivalry with the US. This entrenched an **authoritarian, security-dominated state structure** and deepened its geopolitical isolation, setting the stage for intense **foreign interventions** after 2011."

      "title": "Pre-War Neoliberal Reforms",
      "description": "A key catalyst for the 2011 uprising was the economic policy of the preceding decade. Encouraged by the **IMF** and **World Bank**, the Assad government implemented **neoliberal 'reforms'**: dismantling subsidies, **privatising public assets**, opening the economy to **foreign capital**. This enriched a **crony-capitalist class** while creating mass unemployment and poverty. The protests were partly a rebellion against this rising inequality."

      "title": "Internationalised Proxy Warfare",
      "description": "The Syrian conflict exemplifies a domestic uprising hijacked by **external forces**. Seeking **regime change**, the **US, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar** provided support to a fragmented, radicalised opposition. In response, **Russia and Iran intervened** decisively to preserve the government and secure their **strategic interests** (e.g., Russia's Tartus naval base). This transformed the conflict into a multi-sided **proxy war**, fought to the last Syrian, for **geopolitical dominance**."

The subsequent **US-led intervention** against ISIS, including devastating air campaigns (Raqqa), defeated its 'caliphate' but resulted in the de-facto **US military occupation** of northeast Syria. This intervention further fragmented the country, placed oil/agricultural lands under **US-backed proxy forces**, adding another layer of **imperial entanglement**."
