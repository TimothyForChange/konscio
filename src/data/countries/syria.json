  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon)",
    "legacy": "Ignoring Syrian calls for self-determination (e.g., the Arab Kingdom of Syria), France and Britain imposed the League of Nations Mandate, a colonial project rooted in the imperialist Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916) [British National Archives]. France enforced a 'divide and rule' strategy, fracturing Syria into sectarian statelets to weaken national identity and foster divisions that persist today [James L. Gelvin, 2021]. This policy, combined with exploitative economics and the establishment of a repressive authoritarian state structure, left a legacy of instability and vulnerability to foreign intervention."

  "coreTerms": {
    "inheritedSectarianism": "The Mandate-era strategy of dividing the country along ethnic and religious lines deepened divisions. Today's conflict and foreign interference often exploit these inherited sectarian fractures to advance geopolitical and regional interests, undermining national unity.",
    "stateCollapse": "The post-independence authoritarian regime preserved the repressive state structures of the French Mandate. This inherited framework of control, unable to accommodate popular dissent, ultimately shattered, creating a power vacuum filled by foreign-backed proxy wars and leading to the disintegration of state services."
