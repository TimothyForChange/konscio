  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since **2014**, Ukraine has been resisting a Russian war of aggression that escalated into a **full-scale invasion** in **February 2022**. The conflict has caused mass civilian casualties, millions of displaced people, large-scale destruction of infrastructure, and the systematic imposition of Russian rule and cultural suppression in occupied territories.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Russian Empire & Soviet Union",
    "legacy": "The current war represents the latest phase of centuries of **Russian imperial domination** over Ukraine, characterised by systematic attempts to erase Ukrainian identity and sovereignty. The Russian Empire pursued aggressive **cultural colonisation** through Russification policies (including the 19th-century Valuev Circular and Ems Ukaz that banned Ukrainian language and culture), whilst the Soviet Union continued this **imperial project** through deliberate policies of cultural suppression and political control. The **Holodomor genocide (1932-33)**, which starved millions of Ukrainians to death, represented the extreme manifestation of this colonial violence. Throughout this history, Russian authorities consistently denied Ukrainian **national legitimacy** and treated Ukraine as a colonial possession rather than a distinct nation, setting the ideological foundation for today's **genocidal invasion**."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "contemporaryContext": "Russia's invasion and annexation of Ukrainian territory represents an attempt to reassert influence over areas it considers within its sphere of interest. Moscow's rejection of **Ukrainian sovereignty** and distinct national identity provides the ideological foundation for the military aggression and efforts to suppress Ukrainian culture and identity.",
    "historicalPatterns": "Ukraine's resistance reflects its long struggle for national self-determination and independence. Russia's actions in occupied areas—including imposing Russian curricula, **forced citizenship programmes**, and deportation of children—echo historical patterns of **cultural assimilation policies** aimed at integrating subject populations and undermining distinct national identities."
