  "name": "Ukraine",
  "currentCrisisSummary": "Since Russia's annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014, Ukraine has been resisting a war of aggression that escalated into a full-scale invasion in February 2022. The conflict has resulted in mass civilian casualties, millions displaced, large-scale destruction of civilian infrastructure, and the systematic imposition of Russian rule and cultural suppression in occupied territories.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "Russian Empire and Soviet Union (Successive Imperial Regimes)",
    "legacy": "The conflict is rooted in centuries of **Russian imperialism**, which treated Ukraine as a 'colony' or 'inseparable part' of Russia. This legacy includes forced **Russification**, suppression of the Ukrainian language (e.g., Valuev Circular and Ems Ukaz), elimination of the local intelligentsia, and the intentional famine of the **Holodomor** (1932-33). These historical actions sought to deny and erase a distinct Ukrainian national identity."

  "coreTerms": {
    "neoImperialism": "The Russian Federation's military invasion, seizure, and formal annexation of Ukrainian territory (Crimea, Donbas, etc.) is a clear act of **neo-imperialism** aimed at reconstituting a sphere of domination and denying Ukrainian sovereignty. Moscow's denial of Ukraine's statehood and cultural existence is the ideological justification for the military aggression and the attempted **ethnocide** of the Ukrainian people.",
    "colonialLegacies": "The Ukrainian resistance is fundamentally an **anti-colonial struggle for self-determination** against imperial subjugation. Russia's actions in occupied areas—imposing Russian curricula, forcing Russian citizenship, and deporting children—are classic colonial practices designed to assimilate and absorb a subject population and ensure that Ukraine never fully escapes its former colonial status."
