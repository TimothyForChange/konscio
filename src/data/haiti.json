  "name": "Haiti",
  "currentCrisisSummary": "Haiti faces a complete **state collapse** as heavily-armed gangs control an estimated **60% of Port-au-Prince** and major transport routes. The crisis has triggered mass displacement, a severe humanitarian emergency, and the effective breakdown of public services including healthcare and education. International calls for intervention have intensified as the *de facto authorities* struggle to restore basic governance whilst millions face acute hunger and violence.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (1697-1804)",
    "legacy": "Haiti's modern crises have deep roots in its colonial history as **Saint-Domingue**, France's most profitable colony built on brutal *plantation slavery*. Following the **Haitian Revolution (1791-1804)**—the only successful slave revolt in history—France imposed a crippling *indemnity* of 150 million francs (later reduced to 90 million) as 'compensation' for lost property, including enslaved people. This **debt burden** consumed most of Haiti's national budget for over a century, starving the new nation of resources for development, infrastructure, and institution-building."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "historicalExtraction": "The French indemnity represents one of history's most systematic cases of *colonial extraction* continuing after independence. Haiti was forced to pay France the equivalent of over **$20 billion in today's money**, funds that could have built schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. This *financial stranglehold* created a pattern of **foreign debt dependency** and weakened state capacity that persists today.",
    "externalInterventions": "Throughout the 20th century, Haiti experienced repeated *foreign interventions* that often disrupted local governance without providing sustainable solutions. The **US occupation (1915-1934)**, various UN missions, and international structural adjustment programmes have frequently prioritised external interests over **Haitian sovereignty** and self-determination, contributing to political instability and undermining local institutional development."
