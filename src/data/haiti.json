  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "France (1697-1804)",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in France's brutal slave colony of Saint-Domingue. After the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804)—history's only successful slave revolt—France, backed by Western powers, extorted a crippling 'indemnity' from Haiti in 1825. This payment, demanded as compensation for the loss of enslaved people as 'property', forced Haiti to pay its former enslavers [The New York Times, 'The Ransom', 2022]. The resulting debt peonage crippled the Haitian state for over a century, systematically draining its wealth and preventing any investment in public institutions or infrastructure."
  },
  "coreTerms": {
    "neocolonialDebtAndExtraction": "The French indemnity was a foundational act of neocolonialism, ensuring Haiti's continued economic subjugation after political independence. By forcing Haiti to pay its former colonisers the modern equivalent of over $21 billion [The New York Times, 'The Ransom', 2022], France deliberately engineered a state of permanent underdevelopment. This initial act of extraction created a cycle of debt dependency and foreign control that has defined Haiti's history.",
    "imperialInterventionAndOccupation": "From the US occupation (1915-1934) to a series of UN missions, repeated foreign interventions have systematically undermined Haitian sovereignty. These actions, often framed as 'stabilisation', have supported anti-democratic forces, imposed disastrous economic policies, and created a culture of impunity (e.g., the UN's introduction of cholera [UN Special Rapporteur Report, 2016]). This legacy of intervention has fostered instability and dependency, preventing the emergence of resilient, Haitian-led institutions."
