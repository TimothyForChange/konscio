  "mission": "Critical Humanitarian Analysis",
  "description": "Examining the historical, economic, and political forces behind humanitarian crises across the Global Southâ€”from Palestine to the Sahel. This includes the legacies of colonialism, imperialism, and the rise of global capitalism and neoliberalism, as well as their persistence in neo-colonial and neo-imperialist forms. My goal is to equip people with the knowledge to advocate effectively, provide informed support, and take meaningful action addressing both immediate needs and systemic injustice.",
