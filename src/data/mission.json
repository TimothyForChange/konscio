  "description": "Examining the historical, economic, and political forces that shape humanitarian crises across the Global Southâ€”from Palestine to the Sahel. This includes the legacies of colonialism and imperialism, the dynamics of global capitalism, and the ways these systems persist in neo-colonial and neo-imperialist forms today. Our goal is to equip people with the knowledge to advocate effectively, provide informed support, and engage in meaningful action that addresses both immediate needs and systemic injustice.",
