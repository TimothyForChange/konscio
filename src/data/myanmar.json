    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British rule was built on divide-and-rule tactics that shattered pre-colonial societal structures [Thant Myint-U, 2006]. The British created and racialised ethnic categories, administering the Bamar heartland separately from the ethnic minority 'Frontier Areas'. They strategically used certain minorities in the colonial army against the Bamar majority, manufacturing inter-ethnic resentment. By institutionalising ethnic hierarchies and blocking the development of a unified national identity, Britain left a legacy of a fractured state, laying the groundwork for the world's longest-running civil wars."

  "coreTerms": {
    "ethnoNationalismAndFederalism": "The post-independence state, dominated by the Bamar military (Tatmadaw), has violently enforced a singular, Bamar-centric national identity. The struggle of ethnic resistance organisations for federalism and self-determination is a direct challenge to this chauvinistic, centralised model of the state inherited from the colonial era.",
    "militaryRuleAsInternalColonialism": "The Tatmadaw's rule functions as a form of internal colonialism. It uses extreme violence to control ethnic peripheries and exploit their natural resources for the benefit of a central military elite. The Rohingya genocide [UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, 2018] and the denial of citizenship are the most extreme manifestations of this system, which uses colonial-era ethnic classifications to exclude and persecute."
