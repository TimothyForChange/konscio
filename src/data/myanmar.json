  "currentCrisisSummary": "Myanmar is in a nationwide civil war following the **2021 military coup**. The junta (Tatmadaw) faces widespread armed resistance from the pro-democracy movement and dozens of **Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs)**. The conflict has caused mass displacement and a humanitarian catastrophe, compounding the long-running persecution of the Rohingya.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British colonial rule systematically employed **divide-and-rule tactics** to prevent unified resistance, deliberately creating and exacerbating ethnic divisions for administrative control. The colonial government established separate governance systems for the Bamar majority heartland and ethnic minority **'Frontier Areas,'** whilst strategically recruiting certain minorities (such as Karen and Kachin) into military and administrative roles to create **inter-ethnic tensions**. This colonial manipulation fostered resentment between communities that had coexisted for centuries, whilst other groups were systematically marginalised and excluded from power. The British **institutionalised ethnic hierarchies** and territorial divisions specifically designed to weaken potential unified opposition, creating the structural foundations for the **ethnic conflicts** that have plagued Myanmar since independence."

  "coreTerms": {
    "centralisation": "The military has maintained centralised control for decades, with the Bamar-majority state often at odds with ethnic minority demands for **greater autonomy**. The armed resistance by ethnic groups and pro-democracy movements reflects longstanding tensions over governance structures, federalism, and representation in Myanmar's diverse society.",
    "historicalDivisions": "A key challenge is the persistence of ethnic tensions rooted in colonial-era administrative structures. The military has justified its dominance since the **1962 coup** as necessary for national unity. Groups like the Rohingya face particular discrimination, with **citizenship rights** being contested based on ethnic categories that have historical precedents in colonial-era classifications."
