    "legacy": "British rule was built on **divide-and-rule tactics** that shattered pre-colonial societal structures. The British created and racialised ethnic categories, administering the Bamar heartland separately from the ethnic minority **'Frontier Areas'** [Frontier Areas Enquiry, 1947; Lieberman, 'Strange Parallels', 2003]. They strategically used certain minorities in the colonial army against the Bamar majority, manufacturing **inter-ethnic resentment** [Callahan, 'Making Enemies', 2003]. By **institutionalising ethnic hierarchies** and blocking the development of a unified national identity, Britain left a legacy of a fractured state, laying the groundwork for the world's longest-running civil wars [Smith, 'Burma: Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity', 1999]."

    "ethnoNationalismAndFederalism": "The post-independence state, dominated by the **Bamar military (Tatmadaw)**, has violently enforced a singular, Bamar-centric national identity. The struggle of ethnic resistance organisations for **federalism and self-determination** is a direct challenge to this chauvinistic, centralised model of the state inherited from the colonial era [South, 'Ethnic Politics in Burma', 2008].",
    "militaryRuleAsInternalColonialism": "The Tatmadaw's rule functions as a form of **internal colonialism**. It uses extreme violence to control ethnic peripheries and exploit their natural resources for the benefit of a central military elite [Woods, 'Ceasefire Capitalism', 2011]. The **Rohingya genocide** and the denial of citizenship are the most extreme manifestations of this system, which uses colonial-era ethnic classifications to exclude and persecute [UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, 2018; 1982 Citizenship Law]."
