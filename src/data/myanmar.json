  "currentCrisisSummary": "Myanmar is in a nationwide civil war following the **2021 military coup**. The junta (*Tatmadaw*) faces widespread armed resistance from the *pro-democracy movement* and dozens of **Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs)**. The conflict has caused mass displacement and a humanitarian catastrophe, compounding the long-running persecution of the *Rohingya*.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire (1824-1948)",
    "legacy": "British administration established separate governance systems, managing the *Bamar majority* heartland differently from the ethnic minority-inhabited **'Frontier Areas.'** Colonial policies included recruiting certain minorities (such as *Karen and Kachin*) into the military and administrative services, whilst other groups were marginalised. These *administrative divisions* and differential treatment created tensions that persisted after independence, contributing to ongoing **ethnic conflicts**."

  "coreTerms": {
    "centralisation": "The military has maintained *centralised control* for decades, with the Bamar-majority state often at odds with ethnic minority demands for **greater autonomy**. The armed resistance by ethnic groups and pro-democracy movements reflects longstanding tensions over *governance structures*, *federalism*, and representation in Myanmar's diverse society.",
    "historicalDivisions": "A key challenge is the persistence of *ethnic tensions* rooted in colonial-era administrative structures. The military has justified its dominance since the **1962 coup** as necessary for national unity. Groups like the *Rohingya* face particular discrimination, with **citizenship rights** being contested based on ethnic categories that have historical precedents in colonial-era classifications."
