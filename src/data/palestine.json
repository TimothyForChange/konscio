  "currentCrisisSummary": "An intensifying humanitarian crisis across Gaza and the West Bank, marked by mass displacement, engineered famine, and an ICJ ruling on the plausibility of genocide in Gaza.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire",
    "legacy": "The crisis is rooted in Britain's Mandate (1920-1948). The **Balfour Declaration (1917)**, issued without Palestinian consent, promised their homeland to the Zionist movement. British policy **deliberately fostered conflict** by promoting mass colonial settlement while suppressing Palestinian rights. By 1948, Britain **abandoned its Mandate**, leaving a manufactured crisis for the UN to handle. This abdication directly enabled the **1948 Nakba** ('catastrophe'), where over 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced, creating a refugee crisis Britain refused to resolve. The ongoing **Israeli occupation** is a direct continuation of this colonial legacy of dispossession."

  "coreTerms": {
    "geopoliticalComplicity": "The conflict is sustained by international powers, primarily the **United States**, which provides Israel with billions in unconditional military aid and diplomatic cover at the UN. This imperial backing enables the ongoing occupation and undermines Palestinian self-determination.",
    "settlerColonialismAndApartheid": "The current crisis is a result of unresolved colonial injustices. Key issues include the **right of return** for Palestinian refugees, the illegality of settlements, and the **military occupation**. Leading human rights organisations now describe the system of Israeli control as **apartheid**."

    "casualties": "Over **45,000** killed in Gaza since October 2023, with thousands more missing, presumed dead under the rubble.",
    "affected": "Gaza's entire population of **2.3 million** faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including engineered famine and a decimated healthcare system."
