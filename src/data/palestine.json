  "currentCrisisSummary": "The military assault on Gaza, which began in late 2023 following Hamas's October 7 attack, has caused a catastrophic loss of life, mass displacement, and a severe humanitarian crisis, including famine. This compounds the ongoing, systemic denial of Palestinian rights through settlement expansion and forced displacement in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.",
  "colonialRoot": {
    "colonialPower": "British Empire",
    "legacy": "The conflict's root is the **settler-colonial project of Zionism**, facilitated by the **British Mandate for Palestine (1920-1948)**. The 1917 **Balfour Declaration** promised a 'national home for the Jewish people,' enabling mass immigration and land acquisition while suppressing Palestinian self-determination. The resulting 1948 war (the **Nakba** or 'catastrophe') and the 1967 occupation created the foundation for a regime of **institutionalised dispossession**."

  "coreTerms": {
    "neoImperialism": "**Neo-imperialism** is evident through external actors, particularly the U.S., providing extensive **military aid and diplomatic protection** to Israel. This support enables the maintenance of the occupation and control over Palestinian territory and resources, serving broader Western geopolitical interests in the Middle East.",
    "colonialLegacies": "The ongoing regime of control is widely described by human rights organisations as a system of **apartheid** and **settler colonialism**. Key legacies include the denial of the **right of return** for refugees, **legalised segregation**, **discriminatory land confiscation**, and the **military occupation** of the West Bankâ€”all of which mirror historical colonial practices of domination."
