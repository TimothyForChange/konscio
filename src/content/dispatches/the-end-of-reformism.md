# The End of Reformism: Why the Future Must Be Planned

> "The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class."
> — Karl Marx, The German Ideology (1846)

We are governed by administrators of decline — people who think maintaining collapse is progress.

Reformism, once a hopeful project, has become a politics of delay.
It promises transformation while preserving the system that causes the crisis.
Incrementalism in the face of planetary breakdown is not moderation — it is denial.

## Why Reformism Collapses

Reformism thrived when empire and fossil fuel growth paid for welfare. That era is gone.
Today, reform means managing scarcity through technocracy while real power remains untouched.

Three barriers make reform futile:

1. **Ecological limits** capitalism cannot respect.
2. **Financial domination** that subordinates democracy to markets.
3. **Political capture** that drains dissent into bureaucracy.

The system cannot reform what it is built to protect.

## Democratic Planning as Necessity

Planning is not central control for its own sake — it is democracy scaled to survival.

We already plan: corporations coordinate vast supply chains for profit.
Democratic planning would reclaim that capacity for society itself — allocating resources for life, not accumulation.

It means collective decisions on energy, food, housing, and infrastructure within ecological limits.
It is not nostalgia; it is the only realistic response to crisis.

## The New Planning Horizon

A sustainable future begins with what reformism fears most: redistribution of power.

- Public ownership of key sectors.
- Democratic control of production and trade.
- Ecological ceilings codified in law.
- International cooperation instead of competition.

Existing experiments — participatory budgets in Kerala, cooperative industries in Mondragon, communal councils in Bolivia, local energy systems in Rojava — show what fragments of the future look like.

Planning is not abstract theory. It is already happening wherever people take control of production from capital.

## From Resistance to Construction

We must move beyond opposition to construction — building the world within the shell of the old.

Planning means connecting current struggles — climate movements, labour unions, tenants' associations, community energy cooperatives — into a coherent project.
It is not utopian; it is coordination with purpose.

The real choice is not between moderation and extremism, but between **organisation and extinction.**

## The Democratic Future

Democratic planning is the logic of survival made political.
It transforms the economy from private anarchy into public intelligence — decisions made collectively, guided by care.

> "The future depends on what we do in the present."
> — Mahatma Gandhi

The future will be planned, or it will not exist.

— In solidarity with all who are already planning life beyond profit.
