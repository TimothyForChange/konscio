# The End of Reformism: Why the Future Must Be Planned

> “The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.”
> — Karl Marx, The German Ideology (1846)

## The Age of Managed Decline

We are governed by people who mistake maintenance for meaning.
They manage collapse as if it were a spreadsheet error — balancing budgets while the planet burns. Reformism, once a banner of hope, has curdled into paralysis.

It cannot reconcile capitalism with survival; it was never designed to. Incrementalism has become denial. The planet does not negotiate in policy cycles.

## Why Reformism Fails

Reformism once had a material base — the postwar welfare states of the North funded by colonial plunder and fossil abundance. That foundation is gone. Today, “reform” means preserving catastrophe while pretending to solve it.

Three forces make reform impossible on its own terms:

1. **Ecological limits** that capitalism cannot respect.
2. **Financial domination** that neutralises democracy.
3. **Political capture** that drains dissent into bureaucracy.

The system cannot be persuaded to reform itself. It must be replaced.

## The Necessity of Democratic Planning

Planning is not bureaucracy; it is democracy scaled to survival.
It means collective coordination of life's essentials — energy, housing, food, water, health — guided by need, not profit.

We already plan the world, but in the service of corporations. Democratic socialism would reclaim that capacity for society itself.

## The New Planning Horizon

A planned future begins with what reformism fears most: **expropriation**.

- Public ownership of energy, housing, and infrastructure.
- Democratic control over production and distribution.
- Ecological limits built into law.
- Global solidarity through cooperation, not competition.

The task is to weave existing experiments — participatory budgeting, cooperative economies, local assemblies — into a **democratic plan for life after profit.**

> “The future depends on what we do in the present.”

## From Reform to Renewal

To plan together is to make democracy real.
The choice is not between moderation and extremism, but between organisation and extinction.
The future will be planned — or it will not exist.

— In solidarity with all building democracy from below.
