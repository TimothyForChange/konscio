# The End of Reformism: Why the Future Must Be Planned

> “The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.”
> — Karl Marx, The German Ideology (1846)

## The Age of Managed Decline

We are governed by people who mistake maintenance for meaning.
They manage collapse as if it were a spreadsheet error — balancing budgets while the planet burns. Reformism, once a banner of hope, has curdled into paralysis.

It cannot reconcile capitalism with survival; it was never designed to. Incrementalism has become denial. The planet does not negotiate in policy cycles.

## Why Reformism Fails

Reformism once had a material base — the postwar welfare states of the North funded by colonial plunder and fossil abundance. That foundation is gone. Today, “reform” means preserving catastrophe while pretending to solve it.

Three forces make reform impossible on its own terms. First, ecological limits that capitalism simply cannot respect. Second, financial domination that neutralises democracy. Third, political capture that drains dissent into bureaucracy.

The system cannot be persuaded to reform itself. It must be replaced.

## The Necessity of Democratic Planning

Planning is not bureaucracy; it is democracy scaled to survival.
It means collective coordination of life's essentials — energy, housing, food, water, health — guided by need, not profit.

We already plan the world, but in the service of corporations. Democratic socialism would reclaim that capacity for society itself.

## The New Planning Horizon

A planned future begins with what reformism fears most: expropriation. We need:

- Public ownership of energy, housing, and infrastructure
- Democratic control over production and distribution
- Ecological limits built into law
- Global solidarity through cooperation, not competition

The task is to weave existing experiments — participatory budgeting, cooperative economies, local assemblies — into a democratic plan for life after profit.

Democratic planning is not a utopian dream — it has historical and contemporary examples that demonstrate its viability:

### Historical Precedents

- **Yugoslavia's Self-Management System (1948-1990s):** Workers' councils managed enterprises democratically, balancing central coordination with local autonomy. Despite its eventual decline, it demonstrated that worker control could function at national scale.

- **Kerala's People's Plan (1996-2006):** After winning elections, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) transferred 35-40% of state development funds to local governments. Citizens democratically planned and executed projects, resulting in significant improvements in health, education, and infrastructure.

### Contemporary Experiments

- **Mondragon Cooperatives (Spain):** A federation of worker cooperatives demonstrating that democratic planning can compete with capitalist firms while maintaining worker ownership and democratic governance.

- **Rojava's Democratic Confederalism:** Despite facing war and siege, the region has implemented democratic planning through councils, cooperatives, and women's councils, managing resources and production democratically.

- **Bolivia's Communal Councils:** Following indigenous traditions, these councils coordinate economic activity at local levels while connecting to national planning through the Plurinational State structure.

These examples show that democratic planning is not abstract theory but practical reality — often operating under difficult conditions and facing powerful opposition.

## From Reform to Renewal

To plan together is to make democracy real.
The choice is not between moderation and extremism, but between organisation and extinction.
The future will be planned — or it will not exist.

Democratic planning requires more than good intentions — it needs institutional frameworks, democratic mandates, and mass participation. The struggle for planning is the struggle for democracy itself.

The seeds of the future exist in current struggles: strikes for ecological demands, community energy projects, cooperative food systems, and tenant organizing. The task is to connect these fragments into a coherent alternative — one that prioritizes life over profit, communities over corporations.

Progressive social movements must move beyond resistance to construction — imagining and building the new world within the shell of the old. This is not a distant goal but an immediate task.

— In solidarity with all building democracy from below.
