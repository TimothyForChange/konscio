# The New Monroe Doctrine: Washington's War on Latin America's Sovereignty

> "The strength of the imperialist system as a whole rests on the necessary inequality of its parts."
> — Eduardo Galeano, Open Veins of Latin America (1971)

Empire rarely dies; it mutates.

The U.S. campaign of airstrikes off Colombia and Venezuela revives the Monroe Doctrine — the 19th-century claim that the Western Hemisphere belongs to Washington's sphere.

The pretext has changed from "anti-communism" to "counter-narcotics."
The substance is the same: unilateral force to secure economic and strategic dominance.

## The Escalating Logic of Power

Initial "interdictions" became precision strikes.
Intelligence leaks show planning for land targets inside Venezuela — sovereignty reduced to a military variable.

The old doctrine now flies drones. The geography of empire has digitised, not disappeared.

## The Human and Legal Cost

Coastal and Indigenous communities face bombardment and fear.
Fishing livelihoods collapse; maritime law erodes.
UN experts warn these actions risk **extrajudicial killings** — violations dressed as counter-terrorism.

Empire's violence always begins at the margins.

## Building Regional Resistance

Sovereignty requires solidarity.

**Policy and movement responses:**

- Demand transparency and independent investigations of strikes.
- Revive regional cooperation through reformed UNASUR or ALBA mechanisms.
- Develop South-South trade and payment systems independent of U.S. control.
- Create regional courts to prosecute extraterritorial violations.
- Strengthen ties with anti-imperial movements inside the United States.

True autonomy also needs economic pillars: public ownership of strategic sectors, diversified trade, and regional logistics that bypass Northern chokepoints.

## For a Democratic Hemisphere

Democracy cannot coexist with domination.
A hemisphere ruled by force is one without freedom.

To defend Latin America's sovereignty is to defend the principle that no state has a right to decide for another — the foundation of any just world order.

> "We have no desire to dominate. We only wish to be free."
> — José Martí

— In solidarity with all defending dignity and democracy in the Americas.
