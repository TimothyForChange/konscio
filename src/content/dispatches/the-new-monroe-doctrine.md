# The New Monroe Doctrine: Washington's War on Latin America's Sovereignty

> “The strength of the imperialist system as a whole rests on the necessary inequality of its parts.”
> — Eduardo Galeano, Open Veins of Latin America (1971)

Imperialism adapts — its tools and language shift, its purpose endures: to assert control over politics and resources. The recent US campaign of lethal strikes off Colombia and Venezuela revives that logic. It is not counter-narcotics; it is the **new Monroe Doctrine**.

Strikes have killed dozens since September 2025. Reports suggest US officials have even identified land targets inside Venezuela — escalating from maritime raids to preparations for direct strikes on sovereign soil.

## The Escalating Logic of Empire

This campaign began as “interdiction.” It now resembles military enforcement.
The Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which claimed the Americas as Washington's sphere, lives on through drones and sanctions. The rhetoric has changed — “democracy promotion,” “counter-terrorism,” “narco-terror” — but the right to dominate remains constant.

When a superpower asserts unilateral authority to kill abroad, sovereignty becomes conditional. Latin America is treated as a managed estate, not a community of nations.

## The Human Cost

Fisherfolk and coastal communities pay the price.
Livelihoods collapse under the threat of airstrikes. Legal norms erode. UN experts warn such actions risk **extrajudicial killings** under international law.
Each missile corrodes both life and law.

## Resisting the New Monroe Doctrine

Resistance must be grounded in regional solidarity and international law.

- Demand transparency: strikes must face independent investigation.
- Rebuild regional cooperation through OAS and UN mechanisms.
- Challenge legal impunity that allows extraterritorial killings.
- Address root causes: poverty, inequality, and demand in the North.
- Demilitarise the hemisphere: diplomacy, not dominance.

How do we build resistance? Here are some strategies:

Regional institutions need strengthening. We could revive and reform the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) as a real counterweight to US influence. The OAS should be reformed to reflect regional rather than US interests, and we might need alternative forums outside US influence. A hemispheric court for international law could actually prosecute violations by any state, including the US.

Economic alternatives are equally important. We need to expand South-South trade through mechanisms like the BRICS alliance, which would reduce dependence on North American markets. Creating alternative financial institutions and payment systems - alternatives to SWIFT - would reduce vulnerability to sanctions. Finally, building regional supply chains that minimize dependence on US-controlled logistics would give us more autonomy.

We can also use international law through the International Court of Justice, International Criminal Court, and UN General Assembly to challenge violations of sovereignty.

- Build global coalitions through the Non-Aligned Movement and other Southern multilateral forums
- Develop legal precedents around extraterritorial jurisdiction and violations of sovereignty

### Grassroots and Civil Society Action

- Support fisherfolk, Indigenous, and coastal communities affected by strikes through international solidarity networks
- Build connections with anti-imperial movements in the US to oppose interventionist policies at their source
- Create international monitoring systems to document violations and maintain pressure

### Democratic and Socialist Solutions

- Advance democratic socialist policies that reduce dependence on US markets and investment
- Develop public control over strategic resources to prevent their use as leverage by foreign powers
- Create worker and social movement solidarity across borders to counter elite coordination

The ultimate goal must be a hemispheric order based on genuine equality between nations, not the current hierarchy where geography determines destiny.

## For a Democratic Hemisphere

The fight against imperialism is also a fight for democracy.
A hemisphere where policy is dictated by force cannot be free — and global democracy cannot exist while any region lives under gunpoint.

To stand with Latin America's sovereignty is to stand for a world governed by people, not empires.
Democratic socialism means that international relations, like economies, must be ruled by consent — not coercion.

— In solidarity with all defending sovereignty, dignity, and democracy in the Americas.
