# The New Monroe Doctrine: Washington's War on Latin America's Sovereignty

> “The strength of the imperialist system as a whole rests on the necessary inequality of its parts.”
> — Eduardo Galeano, Open Veins of Latin America (1971)

Imperialism adapts — its tools and language shift, its purpose endures: to assert control over politics and resources. The recent US campaign of lethal strikes off Colombia and Venezuela revives that logic. It is not counter-narcotics; it is the **new Monroe Doctrine**.

Strikes have killed dozens since September 2025. Reports suggest US officials have even identified land targets inside Venezuela — escalating from maritime raids to preparations for direct strikes on sovereign soil.

## The Escalating Logic of Empire

This campaign began as “interdiction.” It now resembles military enforcement.
The Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which claimed the Americas as Washington's sphere, lives on through drones and sanctions. The rhetoric has changed — “democracy promotion,” “counter-terrorism,” “narco-terror” — but the right to dominate remains constant.

When a superpower asserts unilateral authority to kill abroad, sovereignty becomes conditional. Latin America is treated as a managed estate, not a community of nations.

## The Human Cost

Fisherfolk and coastal communities pay the price.
Livelihoods collapse under the threat of airstrikes. Legal norms erode. UN experts warn such actions risk **extrajudicial killings** under international law.
Each missile corrodes both life and law.

## Resisting the New Monroe Doctrine

Resistance must be grounded in regional solidarity and international law.

- **Demand transparency**: strikes must face independent investigation.
- **Rebuild regional cooperation** through OAS and UN mechanisms.
- **Challenge legal impunity** that allows extraterritorial killings.
- **Address root causes**: poverty, inequality, and demand in the North.
- **Demilitarise the hemisphere**: diplomacy, not dominance.

## For a Democratic Hemisphere

The fight against imperialism is also a fight for democracy.
A hemisphere where policy is dictated by force cannot be free — and global democracy cannot exist while any region lives under gunpoint.

To stand with Latin America's sovereignty is to stand for a world governed by people, not empires.
Democratic socialism means that international relations, like economies, must be ruled by consent — not coercion.

— In solidarity with all defending sovereignty, dignity, and democracy in the Americas.
