# The New Monroe Doctrine: Washington's War on Latin America's Sovereignty

Empire rarely dies. It adapts.
The United States once justified domination of the Western Hemisphere with the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 — a claim that no other power had the right to shape Latin America's destiny. Today, that doctrine returns under new language: “counter-narcotics,” “stability,” “security cooperation,” “democracy promotion.” The vocabulary has changed. The structure has not.

The escalation of U.S. military activity around Colombia, Venezuela, and the Caribbean is not an isolated development. It is a reassertion of hemispheric control at a time when multipolar politics, left governments, and regional autonomy threaten long-standing U.S. influence.

What Washington calls security is a struggle for sovereignty — and Latin America is once again on the front line.

## The Escalating Logic of Power

Initial “interdictions” have grown into coordinated air and maritime operations, drone surveillance, and expanded basing agreements across the region. Intelligence leaks point to planning for strikes on land targets inside Venezuelan territory. Sovereignty becomes a variable in a Pentagon calculation.

This evolution fits a long pattern:

- **Operation Condor (1970s):** coordination of dictatorships to eliminate left movements.
- **The Iran-Contra network (1980s):** covert operations and illegal funding to shape regional politics.
- **Plan Colombia (2000s):** counter-narcotics as cover for counter-insurgency, militarisation, and corporate access.
- **Post-2010 basing expansion:** more U.S. presence in Colombia, Panama, Honduras, and the Caribbean.

The doctrine now flies drones instead of B-52s, but the aim is the same: ensure the hemisphere aligns with U.S. strategic and economic priorities.

## The Human and Legal Cost

Communities along the Caribbean and northern South America experience the consequences first. Fishing economies collapse when coastal waters become militarised. Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities face displacement as military operations expand. Cross-border movement becomes criminalised under “anti-trafficking” rhetoric.

International law is eroded through:

- extraterritorial military action without consent,
- unilateral strikes without UN oversight,
- the use of “non-state actor” labels to bypass sovereignty.

Empire's violence always begins at the margins — those with the least visibility and political leverage.

## Why Washington Is Reasserting Control

The revival of the Monroe Doctrine is not ideological nostalgia. It is material.

### Energy and resource security

Latin America holds critical reserves: oil in Venezuela and Guyana, lithium in the Andes, copper in Chile, biodiverse forests across the Amazon. Control over these resources is strategic in an era of energy transition and geopolitical rivalry.

### Political shifts

Left governments in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Bolivia, Honduras, and Chile pursue independent foreign policies, regional integration, and resource nationalism. This threatens the economic architecture Washington relies on.

### China's rise

China has become Latin America's second-largest trade partner and a key investor in infrastructure and minerals. U.S. doctrine responds by militarising influence rather than competing economically.

### Migration politics

Domestic U.S. politics weaponise migration. Militarised “border security” becomes justification for hemispheric interventions, pushing enforcement deeper into Latin American territory.

These pressures converge into a renewed assertion of hemispheric dominance.

## Networks of Complicity

Washington does not operate alone. Regional elites, security forces, and private companies often facilitate U.S. power because they benefit from:

- arms sales,
- training programmes,
- access to U.S. aid,
- protection for extractive concessions,
- and political backing against domestic opposition.

When governments resist, the U.S. works around them through:

- military-to-military agreements,
- intelligence partnerships,
- DEA and SOUTHCOM parallel channels,
- and NGO or private contractor networks.

This creates a shadow architecture of influence that persists even when electorates vote for autonomy.

## Regional Resistance and New Possibilities

Latin America has resisted empire before and is building new forms of resistance today.

### Diplomatic initiatives

CELAC and UNASUR have sought to reduce U.S. dominance in regional institutions. Mexico and Brazil push for non-intervention norms and regional mediation mechanisms.

### Economic integration

New trade and payment systems aim to bypass the U.S. dollar and reduce exposure to sanctions and capital flight.

### People's movements

Grassroots resistance — Indigenous organisations, Afro-descendant movements, feminist networks, trade unions — challenge both militarisation and the corporate interests behind it.

### South-South cooperation

Partnerships with Africa and Asia increasingly prioritise technology transfer, public health, and climate adaptation without U.S. conditionality.

These efforts demonstrate that sovereignty is not only defended by states but by organised societies.

---

## A Democratic Hemisphere

A hemisphere dominated by force cannot be a democratic hemisphere.
True democracy requires:

- the end of extraterritorial military action,
- regional control over resources,
- transparent security agreements,
- independent development financing,
- and a foreign policy that respects the right of nations to determine their own destinies.

Empire insists that security requires domination. Democracy demands the opposite: cooperation without coercion.

---

## Conclusion: Beyond the Monroe Doctrine

The New Monroe Doctrine reveals a simple truth: Latin America's autonomy threatens entrenched power. Washington's response is to tighten its grip under new language and new tools.

But the region is not the same as it was in 1823, 1954, or 2002.
Popular movements are stronger. States are more assertive. Multipolarity creates space for alternatives. And the memory of past interventions fuels resistance rather than fear.

To defend Latin America's sovereignty is to defend the principle that no nation — however powerful — has the right to rule another.

A just hemisphere will not be secured by drones or doctrines, but by solidarity, democracy, and the collective refusal of domination.
