# The Unspoken Alliance: Israel and Apartheid South Africa

> "The relationship between Israel and South Africa was vital for the defence industries of both countries, turning them into major global players."
> — Alon Liel, former Israeli ambassador to Pretoria (interview quoted in _Jacobin_, December 2024)

## Partners in Isolation

The partnership between Israel and apartheid South Africa was more than expediency — it was structural. It joined two settler-colonial regimes facing moral isolation, bound by shared dependence on militarisation, secrecy, and racial control.

## Arms, Intelligence, and Nuclear Links

Weapons, surveillance technologies, and uranium moved between Pretoria and Tel Aviv in defiance of sanctions.
The 2010 revelation that Israel had offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa exposed the depth of this alignment.
These were not theoretical exchanges — they were acts of repression disguised as diplomacy.

## The Human and Ecological Cost

Weapons and counter-insurgency methods supplied by Israel helped sustain apartheid’s violence in South Africa and its wars in Angola and Namibia.
Communities were displaced, budgets militarised, and uranium extraction left poisoned landscapes. The archive of cooperation is an archive of suffering.

## Lessons for Today

This history is not a closed chapter.
It shows how authoritarian and colonial states sustain one another through arms, ideology, and impunity — and how secrecy protects oppression until popular pressure breaks it open.
The same mechanisms now sustain Israeli occupation and surveillance economies across the globe.

To oppose modern empire, we must expose and dismantle these transnational networks of repression.
Transparency, accountability, and solidarity are not moral gestures; they are the material tools of democracy.

## From History to Solidarity

The alliance between Israel and apartheid South Africa teaches a lasting truth: **authoritarian power thrives on global complicity.**

Democratic socialism rejects that complicity. It demands that international relations be governed by the same principles we claim for societies — equality, transparency, and people’s control over power.

The past warns us what happens when profit and security outrank humanity. The future depends on refusing that trade.

— In solidarity with those who resisted apartheid, and with all who struggle against occupation today.
