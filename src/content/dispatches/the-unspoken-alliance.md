# The Unspoken Alliance: Israel and Apartheid South Africa

> "The relationship between Israel and South Africa was vital for the defence industries of both countries, turning them into major global players."

## Partners in Isolation

The partnership between Israel and apartheid South Africa was not a coincidence of convenience — it was structural.
Both regimes were founded on dispossession and racial hierarchy, facing global condemnation while relying on militarisation to survive.
Their alliance joined two projects of control, united by fear of liberation and dependence on secrecy.

## Arms, Intelligence and Nuclear Ties

From the 1970s onward, weapons, technology and uranium moved between Pretoria and Tel Aviv despite UN embargoes.
The 2010 revelation that Israel had offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa exposed the depth of collaboration.

Through the secret _Yahud Memorandum of Understanding_ (1975), Israel and South Africa formalised cooperation in:

- Joint weapons development, including missile technology.
- Electronic warfare and surveillance training.
- Intelligence sharing on liberation movements such as the ANC and SWAPO.

The mysterious **"Double Flash"** event detected by U.S. satellites in 1979 — likely a joint nuclear test — remains a symbol of that era's covert power.

## Networks of Complicity

This alliance extended beyond arms:

- **Personnel exchange:** Pilots and officers trained together.
- **Resource extraction:** Uranium and diamonds flowed both ways through intermediaries.
- **Financial routes:** Shell companies in Europe laundered profits.
- **Diplomatic coordination:** Both regimes defended each other in global forums, masking repression as "security."

These were not separate events but a coherent infrastructure of survival between isolated powers.

## Consequences

The partnership deepened apartheid's war in Angola and Namibia, financed counter-insurgency, and militarised South Africa's budget.
Communities were displaced, rivers poisoned by uranium mining, and liberation delayed.
The costs were human and ecological — a system of domination spanning borders.

## Lessons for the Present

This history shows how oppressive regimes sustain one another through weapons, ideology and silence.
Its legacy endures in today's global arms trade and surveillance economies.
The structures of complicity — profit before people, secrecy before accountability — remain intact.

To challenge empire today means dismantling these transnational circuits of repression and demanding transparency as a condition of peace.

## From History to Solidarity

The past is not dead; it instructs.
It reminds us that authoritarianism flourishes when nations trade morality for markets.
The task is to ensure that global alliances serve liberation, not domination.

— In memory of those who resisted apartheid, and standing with all resisting occupation now.
