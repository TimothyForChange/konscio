# The Unspoken Alliance: Israel and Apartheid South Africa

> "The relationship between Israel and South Africa was vital for the defence industries of both countries, turning them into major global players."
> — Alon Liel, former Israeli ambassador to Pretoria

## Partners in Isolation

The partnership between Israel and apartheid South Africa was not a coincidence of convenience. It was structural.
Both states were built on dispossession and enforced hierarchy, confronted international criticism, and relied on military power to maintain control. Under those conditions, cooperation was not simply useful — it was inevitable.

Their alliance joined two projects of domination shaped by shared fears: the fear of liberation movements, regional isolation, and the collapse of their internal racial orders.

## Arms, Intelligence, and Nuclear Collaboration

From the mid-1970s onward, weapons systems, surveillance technology, and raw materials moved between Pretoria and Tel Aviv despite UN embargoes.

In 1975, the two governments formalised deep cooperation through a secret memorandum that opened the door to:

- Joint missile and artillery development,
- Electronic warfare and intelligence training,
- Exchanges on counterinsurgency,
- Surveillance of liberation movements like the ANC, SWAPO, and PAC,
- Gold for weapons,
- Oil for influence,
- Rare earths for technology.

Uranium shipments from South Africa supported Israel's nuclear programme, while Israeli engineers and technicians supported South Africa's defence industries.

The **1979 “double flash”** detected by a US satellite in the South Atlantic has long been debated. Some analysts believe it indicates a joint nuclear test; others point to instrumentation error. What matters historically is the context: both governments had the capacity, the secrecy, and the motive for collaboration at that level, making the event emblematic of their covert partnership rather than definitive proof of a test.

The 2010 release of South African archival documents — including discussions of potential Israeli warhead sales — showed how far the relationship had developed, even if the full details remain contested.

## Networks of Complicity

The alliance stretched far beyond weapons.

- **Personnel:** Israeli and South African officers trained together, sharing tactics for air operations and internal security.
- **Extractive links:** Uranium, industrial diamonds, and electronics components circulated between private firms operating as intermediaries.
- **Financial conduits:** Shell companies in Europe and the Gulf moved funds around embargoes.
- **Diplomatic coordination:** Each regime offered political cover to the other in global institutions, presenting repression as “security” and occupation as “stability.”

_This was not improvisation. It was an organised architecture that allowed two pariah states to reinforce each other’s power._

## Consequences

_The partnership strengthened Pretoria’s military capacity during its wars in Angola and Namibia, delaying regional liberation and intensifying repression at home._
_It also militarised South Africa’s budget, deepened surveillance, and expanded the reach of its security state._

_Communities near uranium and weapons-production sites lived with pollution and displacement._
_The human and ecological damage was not incidental — it was built into the cooperation itself._

## Lessons for the Present

This history shows how regimes facing moral and political isolation turn to each other for survival. Their collaboration rested on secrecy, shared ideology, and the logic of militarised control.

_The patterns established then — joint weapons development, surveillance exports, and resource-for-security networks — still define the global arms trade today._
The infrastructure that sustained apartheid did not vanish with its collapse; it was global, and much of it survives in updated forms.

Challenging contemporary militarism requires dismantling these transnational circuits of profit and impunity, not only confronting individual states.

## From History to Solidarity

The past is instructive. It reminds us that authoritarian projects rarely stand alone. They form alliances, trade expertise, and insulate each other from accountability.

Remembering this is not an academic exercise. It is part of the work of global solidarity: understanding how systems of domination reinforce each other, and how movements for justice can do the same.

— In memory of those who resisted apartheid, and in solidarity with all facing occupation and dispossession today.
