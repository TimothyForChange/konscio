# The Unspoken Alliance: Israel and Apartheid South Africa

> "The relationship between Israel and South Africa was vital for the defence industries of both countries, turning them into major global players."
> — Alon Liel, former Israeli ambassador to Pretoria (interview quoted in _Jacobin_, December 2024)

## Partners in Isolation

The partnership between Israel and apartheid South Africa was more than expediency — it was structural. It joined two settler-colonial regimes facing moral isolation, bound by shared dependence on militarisation, secrecy, and racial control.

## Arms, Intelligence, and Nuclear Links

Weapons, surveillance technologies, and uranium moved between Pretoria and Tel Aviv in defiance of sanctions.
The 2010 revelation that Israel had offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa exposed the depth of this alignment.
These were not theoretical exchanges — they were acts of repression disguised as diplomacy.

The alliance began formalising in the 1970s through the **Yahud Memorandum of Understanding** in 1975, a secret agreement between Israel's defence ministry and South Africa's Armaments Corporation (Armscor). This pact facilitated:

- **Weapons development:** Joint production of the L-339 "Derby" air-to-air missile and cooperation on the L-337 "Popeye" cruise missile.
- **Technology transfer:** Israeli radar systems, electronic warfare equipment, and counter-insurgency tactics.
- **Intelligence sharing:** Information on liberation movements, particularly the ANC and SWAPO.

**Nuclear cooperation** was particularly significant. Documents revealed by the Soviet Union and later confirmed by investigative journalists point to:

- Joint nuclear testing: The mysterious "Double Flash" event of 22 September 1979 detected by US Vela satellites in the South Atlantic, likely a joint Israeli-South African nuclear test.
- Uranium supply: South Africa provided yellowcake uranium to Israel in exchange for nuclear technology and expertise.
- Technological exchange: Israel gained access to South African uranium enrichment technology while sharing knowledge about nuclear weapon design.

The relationship was facilitated by **Adnan Khashoggi**, a Saudi arms dealer who served as an intermediary. The deals were structured through front companies and third countries to circumvent UN arms embargoes.

## The Mechanisms of Cooperation

The alliance operated through multiple channels:

**Personnel Exchange:** Israeli military advisors worked in South African defense installations, while South African pilots trained in Israel. This included cooperation in developing counter-insurgency tactics used against liberation movements.

**Resource Extraction:** Israel helped South Africa develop offshore diamond mining capabilities, while South Africa secured Israeli investments in gold mining operations.

**Economic Networks:** The alliance created a parallel economic system to circumvent sanctions, with Israeli companies investing in South African operations and vice versa through shell companies in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and other jurisdictions.

**Diplomatic Coordination:** In international forums like the UN, both countries often coordinated positions on decolonization issues and used their respective lobbies to support each other's positions.

## Operations and Consequences

The cooperation had direct effects on southern African politics:

- **War in Angola and Namibia (1975-2002):** Israeli-supplied weapons and intelligence played a crucial role in South Africa's military operations against Cuban forces, Angolan liberation movements (MPLA), and Namibian independence fighters (SWAPO).
- **Internal repression:** Israeli-developed surveillance technology and counter-insurgency methods were deployed against anti-apartheid activists within South Africa, including during the Soweto uprising and other periods of mass resistance.
- **Regional destabilization:** The alliance contributed to broader patterns of destabilization across southern Africa, with Israel-South Africa cooperation extending to support for right-wing forces in Mozambique and other countries.

## The Human and Ecological Cost

Weapons and counter-insurgency methods supplied by Israel helped sustain apartheid's violence in South Africa and its wars in Angola and Namibia.
Communities were displaced, budgets militarised, and uranium extraction left poisoned landscapes. The archive of cooperation is an archive of suffering.

## Lessons for Today

This history is not a closed chapter.
It shows how authoritarian and colonial states sustain one another through arms, ideology, and impunity — and how secrecy protects oppression until popular pressure breaks it open.
The same mechanisms now sustain Israeli occupation and surveillance economies across the globe.

To oppose modern empire, we must expose and dismantle these transnational networks of repression.
Transparency, accountability, and solidarity are not moral gestures; they are the material tools of democracy.

## From History to Solidarity

The alliance between Israel and apartheid South Africa teaches a lasting truth: **authoritarian power thrives on global complicity.**

Democratic socialism rejects that complicity. It demands that international relations be governed by the same principles we claim for societies — equality, transparency, and people's control over power.

The past warns us what happens when profit and security outrank humanity. The future depends on refusing that trade.

— In solidarity with those who resisted apartheid, and with all who struggle against occupation today.
