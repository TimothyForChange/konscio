# Ukraine and the Empire of War: How Capital Profits from Catastrophe

## The Global Engine of War

The conflict in Ukraine is less an anomaly than a mirror.
It reveals how a world order built on extraction converts tragedy into opportunity — weapons, energy, reconstruction, debt.

NATO expansion and Russian aggression reflect the same structure: imperial competition sustained by fossil capital and profit logic.
Ordinary people bear the cost; corporations collect the dividends.

---

## From Empire to Market

The road to war was paved in the 1990s.
Privatisation gutted the post-Soviet economy; oligarchs rose from public ruin; Western capital entered under the banner of reform.
Russia fused nationalism with petro-capitalism.
Ukraine became frontier and battlefield between rival empires — Western and Russian — each seeking markets and influence.

---

## War as Business

Since 2022, defence stocks soared, fossil profits exploded, and reconstruction funds turned into privatisation schemes.
Every bomb dropped creates new contracts; every sanction redirects markets.
"Rebuilding" already means deregulation and debt — a future mortgaged before peace arrives.

War is not only destruction; it is investment strategy.

---

## Ecocide and Exploitation

Beyond casualties lie poisoned soil, mined farmland, and rivers laced with toxins.
Ukraine's ecological recovery may take generations.
This is war as environmental catastrophe — and as profit opportunity for those selling the cleanup.

---

## Selective Solidarity

Western powers frame the conflict as moral crusade while backing other aggressions elsewhere.
Some victims count; others are collateral.
This hierarchy reveals consistency, not hypocrisy: empire always defends its own.

---

## Building a Just Peace

True peace requires dismantling the economy of war.
That means cancelling debt, nationalising reconstruction, demilitarising Europe, and redirecting budgets toward life — food, energy, and health.
Without structural change, "rebuilding" becomes recolonisation.

Justice demands disarming the system that profits from suffering — for Ukraine, and for the planet it helps destroy.

— For a world where life, not profit, guides our response to crisis.
