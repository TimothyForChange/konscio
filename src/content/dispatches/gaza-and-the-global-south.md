# Gaza and the Global South: Imperialism's Mirror

> "There will be no global climate justice, no global just transition without the liberation of Palestine."
> — Hamza Hamouchene, Transnational Institute (2025)

Gaza is a mirror of empire, not an aberration.

The same powers that destroy forests in the Congo, exploit cobalt for "green" technologies and impose debt on Africa supply bombs and diplomatic cover to Israel.

Palestine reveals, in concentrated form, the moral and structural logic of global empire: domination through dispossession, justified by the language of civilisation, progress, and security.

As of late 2025 more than **69,000 Palestinians have been killed** since the assault on Gaza began in October 2023.

Entire hospitals and universities have been levelled. Over **two million people** remain trapped — starved, bombed and displaced in what UN experts call a _textbook case of genocide_.

Even the declared "ceasefire" offered no reprieve. On **29 October 2025** Israeli strikes during the truce killed **104 people in a single day**, including dozens of children, according to Gaza health authorities cited by _Reuters_.

A pause became another episode of annihilation — a reminder that for colonised peoples peace under empire is often only a change in tempo.

This extends beyond war itself. It involves a world order built on the belief that some lives and some lands are expendable for profit and control.

## The Architecture of Domination

The genocide in Gaza did not begin in **2023**. It began with **settler colonialism** — economic and racial logic of empire carried into the twenty-first century.
The British Mandate, the Balfour Declaration, and the Zionist project were all instruments of the same system that partitioned Africa, enslaved millions, and enclosed the Earth's commons for capital.

The methods evolve: sanctions instead of gunboats, drones instead of gunpowder; the structure endures — **the right to dominate, the right to extract, the right to decide who lives and who dies.**

In Palestine: siege, surveillance and bombing.
In the Congo: mining concessions and militarised dispossession.
In Haiti: debt and occupation disguised as "stability".
In Bolivia and Colombia: militarised resource zones feeding global markets. Different geographies; one architecture.

## How Empire Operates

### Weapons as Commodities

Israel's bombardment of Gaza is enabled by a transnational military-industrial complex that profits from endless war.
The same corporations — **Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Thales, Northrop Grumman** — sell weapons tested on Palestinians then exported as "battle-proven". Occupation becomes a laboratory for repression exported to police borders, refugees and protesters.

Class interests are clear. **Defence contractors** profit from perpetual conflict. **Technology firms** sell surveillance systems monitoring Palestinian movement. **Energy companies** seek offshore gas. **Real estate developers** plan settlements on cleared land. **Financial institutions** profit from arms loans to reconstruction bonds.

Against them stand **workers** displaced by militarisation; **communities** facing austerity while weapons spending soars; **young people** inheriting ecological collapse accelerated by military emissions; **colonised peoples** worldwide recognising shared patterns of dispossession.

### Finance and Control

Empire no longer rules by flag; it rules through **debt, trade regimes and sanctions**.
IMF austerity in Africa, World Bank "development projects" in Asia, and U.S. sanctions on states that resist all sustain a hierarchy of dependence. The same countries that arm Israel also control the institutions that discipline the Global South.

Financial architecture enabling genocide operates through mundane mechanisms: **bond markets finance weapons purchases**; **banking systems clear payments** via SWIFT; **insurance companies cover shipments and infrastructure**; **pension funds and asset managers** hold defence portfolios, institutionalising pressure to sustain conflict.

This is concrete complicity: every cleared payment, insured shipment and traded bond makes genocide possible. Institutions refusing banking services to Palestinian NGOs enable flows destroying Palestinian life.

### Media and Moral Legitimacy

The ideological front of empire is built through narratives: "self-defence", "democracy", "stability."
These words disguise structural violence, framing victims as threats and resistance as terrorism.

## The Ecological Dimensions of Occupation

Settler colonialism is not only political; it is **ecological**.
In Palestine olive groves uprooted, aquifers stolen, farmland bombed into dust. In Africa forests razed for profit and rivers poisoned by mines. Logic: control nature, displace people, privatise life.

The **ecocide in Gaza** — flattened farmland, poisoned soil and sea, contaminated water — mirrors slow violence across the Global South. Climate collapse is imperialism in ecological form, not accident.

Demilitarisation and ecological regeneration are inseparable. Metals building tanks could rebuild irrigation; capital funding war could restore rivers and forests. Disarmament is renewal.

## Global Solidarity in Practice

Across the Global South Palestine is a rallying point — not charity but shared experience.
From Johannesburg to Jakarta, Caracas to Cairo, movements recognise Gaza as **front line of global imperialism**.

- South African activists invoke apartheid memory to call for **boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS)** — echoing their own struggle.
- Congolese and Sudanese organisers link struggles against extraction to the fight against occupation.
- Indigenous movements in the Americas and Pacific see parallels in **land theft, militarisation and cultural erasure**.
- South Africa’s case at the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** asserts what the Global North refuses: genocide cannot be justified by power.
- Across Latin America Indigenous environmental defenders connect struggles against extractive violence to the Palestinian cause.
- In the Global North youth climate movements defy repression and refuse separation between _ecological_ and _anti-imperialist_ politics.

This is **internationalism reborn** — solidarity not as sentiment but as structure: an alliance of the dispossessed against empire in all its forms.

**Concrete victories mount.** University campaigns divest billions from Israeli bonds and defence contractors. Port workers in Oakland, Barcelona and Durban refuse Israeli cargo. Municipal BDS resolutions in 30+ cities end contracts with complicit firms. Student occupations force investment transparency. Healthcare workers document medical apartheid and testify internationally.

These campaigns succeed because they target genocide’s material infrastructure: finance, logistics, procurement, legitimacy. Solidarity is strategic action weakening empire’s capacity to kill.

## Empire or Life: The Fundamental Choice

The West calls this a "conflict". What we witness is the logic of **colonial modernity** laid bare: a civilisation justifying genocide in the name of order, progress or security.

To stand with Gaza is to stand against the system treating life as expendable — the same system driving climate breakdown, debt slavery and resource plunder. Eco-socialism and decolonisation are practical demands of survival.

True solidarity means dismantling the global military-financial complex and building a world where resources serve life, not empire.

## Beyond the Current System

The task before us is not reform but replacement. A post-imperial world requires:

- **Demilitarisation and reparations**: redirect trillions spent on war towards climate justice and reconstruction.
- **Sovereignty for the dispossessed**: from Palestine to the Sahel, self-determination and resource control.
- **Degrowth and decolonisation in the North**: confront overconsumption and the illusion of endless expansion.
- **Planetary solidarity**: internationalism built on justice, not hierarchy.

The fight for Gaza is the fight for Earth: the same empire that flattens homes burns forests and poisons rivers. Every bomb dropped on Gaza is a declaration of war on life.

## The Struggle Transcends Borders

In Gaza’s ruins we see a collective reflection: a civilisation willing to annihilate children for land will annihilate the planet for profit. The line between Palestine and the planet is thin.

> "But we know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians; without the resolution of conflicts in East Timor, the Sudan and other parts of the world."
> — Nelson Mandela (1997)

To fight for Gaza is to fight for life. Silence sides with empire.

— In solidarity with Palestine, the Global South and all who resist extinction.
