# Gaza and the Global South: Imperialism's Mirror

> "There will be no global justice, no true democracy, without the liberation of Palestine."
> — Hamza Hamouchene, Transnational Institute (2025)

Gaza is a mirror, not an exception.

The powers that destroy forests in the Congo, impose debt on Africa, and extract cobalt for "green" technologies also supply the bombs and funding that devastate Palestine.

Palestine exposes the global order's core logic: domination through dispossession, justified by the language of civilisation and security.

By late 2025, over 69,000 Palestinians had been killed since the assault began in 2023. Hospitals, universities, and homes lie in ruins.
A "ceasefire" became another phase of annihilation — a reminder that for colonised peoples, peace under empire is only a pause between assaults.

## The Architecture of Domination

The genocide did not start in 2023. It began with settler colonialism — empire extended through racial capitalism.
The British Mandate, the Balfour Declaration, and the Zionist project mirrored the logic that partitioned Africa and enslaved millions.

Empire modernises its tools: sanctions instead of gunboats, drones instead of bayonets.
The structure endures — control over land, life, and labour.

## Empire's Mechanisms

### Weapons and Profit

War is business.
The same firms — Lockheed Martin, BAE, Thales — test weapons on Palestinians and sell them worldwide.
Occupation becomes a laboratory for repression later deployed on migrants and protesters.

### Finance and Control

Empire governs through finance as much as force.
Debt, trade rules, and sanctions sustain hierarchy.
The same institutions that fund militarism abroad dictate austerity at home.

### Media and Legitimacy

Language sanitises domination.
"Self-defence," "stability," and "security" conceal massacre and dispossession.

## The Ecological Front

Occupation is also ecological.
Farmland bombed, aquifers seized, olive groves uprooted — an environment rendered uninhabitable.
This mirrors the slow violence of extraction across the Global South: poisoned rivers, razed forests, displaced people.

True reconstruction must include ecological restoration — repairing land as well as lives.

---

## Global Solidarity in Practice

From Johannesburg to Jakarta, movements recognise Gaza as a shared struggle.
Solidarity takes material form:
dockworkers refusing Israeli cargo, universities divesting from arms and apartheid, healthcare workers documenting medical blockade.

These are not gestures — they are acts of disruption against empire's logistics.

## Beyond Empire

To stand with Gaza is to stand against the system that treats life as expendable — the same system driving climate collapse, debt bondage, and extraction.

A just world requires:

- Demilitarisation and reparations — resources for reconstruction, not destruction.
- Self-determination for dispossessed peoples.
- Economic democracy — production controlled by communities, not corporations.
- Global solidarity linking North and South through shared survival.

## Closing Reflection

In Gaza's ruins, the global crisis reveals itself.
A civilisation willing to annihilate children for land will annihilate the planet for profit.

> "Our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians."
> — Nelson Mandela (1997)

To fight for Gaza is to fight for a world where no empire decides who may live and who must die.

— In solidarity with Palestine, the Global South, and all who defend life.
