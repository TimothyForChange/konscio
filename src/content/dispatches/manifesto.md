# Manifesto: For People and Planet

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse form one system of domination expressed through different forms — not separate crises.
The same logic that enslaved and extracted from the Global South now drives ecological destruction across the Earth.

**The Red Soil** exists to confront that system — not as neutral commentary, but as _critical resistance._

Written from South Africa, in solidarity with all who struggle against empire, exploitation, and ecological collapse, this platform stands in the long tradition of liberation thought: the belief that the fight for human freedom and the fight for the living planet are inseparable.

## What This Site Stands For

- **Eco-Socialism:** Building a just and democratic world where the economy sustains life instead of destroying it — centering collective ownership, equality, and ecological balance.
- **Decolonisation:** Dismantling the political, cultural, and economic power structures inherited from empire, and imagining new ways of being beyond colonial modernity.
- **Global Solidarity:** Linking the struggles of the South and the North, because liberation anywhere depends on justice everywhere.
- **Structural Analysis:** Naming root causes, not symptoms — because oppression and ecological collapse are systemic, not accidental.
- **Collective Power:** Real change comes from democratic movements and organised people, not reform handed down from above.

## Why It Matters

We live in an age of planetary emergency — ecological, economic, and moral.
The forces that profit from destruction will not dismantle themselves.

The task ahead is not merely to survive, but to _build an alternative_ rooted in justice, democracy, and care for the Earth.
**The Red Soil** is a small contribution to that struggle — a space for analysis, solidarity, and collective imagination in the service of life.

## What to Expect

This publication will feature essays, reflections, and analyses from multiple voices exploring how global systems of power operate — and how they can be transformed through democratic, ecological struggle.

Contributions will examine the intersections between:

- Capitalism and climate breakdown
- Colonialism and global inequality
- Technology and extractivism
- Movements for democracy, justice, and sustainability

Each contribution will ask one central question:
**What must change for people and planet to thrive — and how do we make it happen together?**

## Closing Thought

To write is to resist forgetting.
To analyse is to fight despair with understanding.
To imagine a better world is already an act of defiance.

This space is not neutral ground.
It is a call to action: to think, write, and act for life.
