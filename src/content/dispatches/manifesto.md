# Manifesto: For People and Planet

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse represent one system of domination expressed through different forms, not separate crises.
The same logic that enslaved and extracted from the Global South now drives ecological collapse across the planet.

**The Red Soil** exists to confront that system — not as neutral commentary, but as _critical resistance._

Written from South Africa, in solidarity with all who struggle against empire, exploitation, and environmental destruction, this platform stands in the long tradition of liberation thought: the belief that the fight for human freedom and the fight for ecological survival are inseparable.

## What This Site Stands For

- **Democratic Socialism:** Building a just and democratic world where the economy serves people and planet, not private profit.
- **Decolonisation:** Dismantling the political, cultural, and economic power structures inherited from empire.
- **Global Solidarity:** Linking the struggles of the South and the North, because liberation anywhere depends on justice everywhere.
- **Structural Analysis:** Naming root causes, not symptoms, because oppression is systemic, not accidental.
- **Collective Power:** Real change comes from democratic movements and organised people, not reform handed down from above.

## Why It Matters

We live in a time of planetary emergency — ecological, economic, and moral.
The forces that profit from destruction will not dismantle themselves.

The task ahead is not merely to survive, but to _build an alternative_ rooted in justice, democracy, and care for the Earth.
**The Red Soil** is a small contribution to that struggle — a space for critical analysis, solidarity, and collective imagination.

## What to Expect

This publication will feature essays, reflections, and analyses from multiple voices exploring how global systems of power operate, and how they can be transformed through democratic struggle.

Contributions will examine the intersections between:

- Capitalism and ecological breakdown
- Colonialism and global inequality
- Technology and extractivism
- Movements for democracy, justice, and sustainability

Each contribution will ask one central question:
**What must change for people and planet to thrive — and how do we make it happen together?**

## Closing Thought

To write is to resist forgetting.
To analyse is to fight despair with understanding.
To imagine a better world is already an act of defiance.

This space is not neutral ground.
It is a call to action: to think, write, and act for life.
