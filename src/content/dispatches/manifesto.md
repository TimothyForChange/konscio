# Manifesto: For People and Planet

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are not separate crises. They are different faces of one system of domination.

The same logic that once extracted from the Global South now drives ecological ruin across the planet.

**The Red Soil** exists to challenge that system. It is not a neutral platform. It is a form of critical resistance.

This project is written from South Africa, in solidarity with everyone fighting empire, exploitation, and ecological breakdown. It stands in a long tradition of liberation thought, which holds that the struggle for human freedom and the struggle for the living planet are one and the same.

## What This Site Stands For

- Eco Socialism: Build a world where the economy sustains life instead of destroying it. Put collective ownership, equality, and ecological balance at the centre.
- Decolonisation: Dismantle the political, cultural, and economic power structures inherited from empire. Create new ways of living beyond colonial modernity.
- Global Solidarity: Connect the struggles of the South and the North. Liberation anywhere relies on justice everywhere.
- Structural Analysis: Name the root causes, not the symptoms. Oppression and ecological collapse are systemic, not accidental.
- Collective Power: Real change grows from organised movements and ordinary people acting together. It is not something handed down from above.

## Why It Matters

We live in an age of planetary emergency - ecological, economic, and moral.
The forces that profit from destruction will not dismantle themselves.

The task ahead is not only to survive, but to build an alternative grounded in justice, democracy, and care for the Earth.

**The Red Soil** is a small offering to that work, a space for analysis, solidarity, and shared imagination in the service of life.

## What to Expect

This publication will feature essays, reflections, and analysis from many voices. They will examine how global systems of power work and how they can be changed through democratic and ecological struggle.

Contributions will examine the intersections between:

- Capitalism and climate breakdown
- Colonialism and global inequality
- Technology and extractivism
- Movements for democracy, justice, and sustainability

Each contribution will ask one central question:

**What must change for people and planet to thrive, and how do we make it happen together?**

## Closing Thought

_To write is to resist forgetting._
_To analyse is to fight despair with understanding._
_To imagine a better world is already an act of defiance._

This space is not neutral ground.
_It is a call to action: to think, write, and act for life._

Welcome to **The Red Soil**, for people and planet.
