description: "A democratic socialist and decolonial analysis of how global supply chains extract Congolese land and labour for the Global North's so-called green transition — exposing how climate policy reproduces empire under new language."
excerpt: "The DRC's cobalt fuels the world's ‘green' technologies, but the price is paid by its people and ecosystems. This essay examines how the green transition repeats colonial extraction — and how democratic control of resources could break the cycle."

# Green Colonialism: The DRC and the Green Transition

The Democratic Republic of Congo is presented to the world as a resource — a seam of minerals waiting to be mined, refined, and exported.

Corporate reports and policy papers tell a story of progress: cobalt for batteries, coltan for phones, lithium for storage — a sleek narrative of salvation through consumption. But look closer, and the "green transition" of the Global North reveals itself as an old pattern in new clothes — **a new colonial order built on the same extraction logic.**

This is not a story about scarcity. It is about **power** — who owns the minerals, who captures the value, and who pays the human and ecological cost.

## Old Empire, New Language

The patterns playing out in the DRC are not anomalies of the present but continuations of empire. The Congo has long been treated as a mine with borders — from Leopold II's atrocities to today's supply chains.
What changes is the vocabulary: civilisation becomes development; humanitarian aid becomes investment; extraction becomes sustainability.

> “The Congo Free State was not a colony but the world's only private colony — the personal possession of a single individual.”
> — Adam Hochschild, King Leopold's Ghost (1998)

That logic never died. It was privatised, financialised, and repackaged as development. Today, corporations and foreign governments invoke climate urgency to justify the same model: **external control, internal devastation.**

## The Green Transition's Extraction Imperative

The Global North's shift to “clean” technologies demands vast quantities of cobalt, lithium, and copper. This demand is framed as moral — to “save the planet.” But morality cannot disguise the material continuity of exploitation.

- **Value extraction:** The DRC provides around **70% of the world's cobalt**, yet less than **5%** is refined domestically. Most profits accrue abroad — in refining, manufacturing, and branding.
- **New colonial actors:** Chinese, Western, and Gulf capital dominate. Roughly **80%** of Congolese cobalt output is under Chinese control. Capital changed flags; the system did not.
- **Engineered instability:** Weak governance and conflict keep extraction cheap and control secure. Crisis is not collateral damage — it is a business model.
- **Green rhetoric as cover:** Label a mine “critical for the energy transition,” and exploitation becomes virtue. Consumers are absolved; corporations are praised.

| **Indicator**      | **DRC Share / Situation**             | **External Control**       | **Notes**                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Cobalt production  | ~70% of world supply                  | —                          | DRC dominates raw output           |
| Refining capacity  | <5% in DRC                            | >95% abroad (mainly China) | Value captured externally          |
| Corporate control  | —                                     | ~80% by Chinese firms      | New managers, same logic           |
| Price differential | 1× (raw ore)                          | 20× (refined cobalt)       | Illustrates value drain            |
| Ecological cost    | Severe local pollution, deforestation | Externalised               | Environmental burden shifted south |

This “green colonialism” turns climate responsibility into another form of imperial privilege. The very technologies meant to avert catastrophe deepen it elsewhere.

## The Human and Ecological Toll

Extraction is not abstract economics — it is lived devastation.

Communities around mines report poisoned rivers, destroyed farmland, and armed displacement. Informal miners, including children, work under lethal conditions. Those who protest are met with military repression.

Meanwhile, the **Congo Basin rainforest** — one of Earth's largest carbon sinks — is collapsing under the combined pressures of mining, logging, and climate change. It stores around **8 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent**, yet the mining required for “green” tech accelerates deforestation, erodes soil, and releases stored carbon.

Each electric vehicle battery contains **8 kilograms of cobalt**. Its production often emits more carbon than the car will offset in its early years of use. The “green transition” becomes the South's new form of climate sacrifice.

Ecological destruction is not the cost of progress — it is the condition of profit.

## The Democratic Socialist Alternative

The answer is not isolationism but **democratic control** — over resources, production, and technology.
A just energy transition cannot be built on extractive imperialism. It must redistribute power along with wealth.

**Key principles:**

1. **Public ownership and control** of mining and refining, ensuring profits fund public goods rather than oligarchs or foreign shareholders.
2. **Local value addition** — refining, manufacturing, and research inside the DRC to retain jobs, skills, and wealth.
3. **Ecological limits enshrined in law**, with production guided by need, not endless accumulation.
4. **Global reparations and technology transfer** from the North to the South to correct historic imbalance.
5. **International solidarity among workers and communities** resisting extractive regimes — from Congo to Chile, Bolivia to Indonesia.

Democratic socialism demands that the green transition serve humanity, not markets.

## Local Resistance and Community Power

Change is already happening from below.

- In **Lualaba Province (2019)**, community activists forced compensation from Chinese firm Sicomines for pollution.
- The **Observatoire Congolais des Droits de l'Homme (OCDH)** documented abuses and secured safety reforms.
- **Artisanal cooperatives** organised to negotiate better prices.
- **Civil society pressure (2023)** forced suspension of mining licences pending environmental review.

These struggles show that agency endures even in brutal conditions. They remind us that liberation is not delivered from abroad but built through collective organisation and solidarity.

## Rethinking Global Responsibility

It is not enough to pity the Congo or call for “ethical sourcing.”
The task is structural: dismantling the system that treats Congolese labour and land as expendable inputs for Northern prosperity.

Those who claim to lead the climate fight must confront the imperial architecture that makes “green growth” possible.
A battery made with forced labour and poisoned rivers is not progress — it is colonialism with better branding.

Democratic socialism offers the only path capable of aligning climate justice with social justice:
**production for need, not profit; ownership for people, not corporations; solidarity beyond borders.**

## Beyond Greenwashing: Toward Justice

True climate justice requires more than carbon accounting. It requires historical reckoning and material redistribution.

**To act in solidarity:**

- Support Congolese and African-led environmental and labour movements.
- Demand transparency from corporations and governments sourcing critical minerals.
- Campaign for climate finance as grants and reparations — not loans.
- Link Northern climate movements to Southern struggles for sovereignty.

The DRC is not the world's mine; it is part of the world's future.
The struggle for its liberation — political, economic, and ecological — is a struggle for all humanity.
