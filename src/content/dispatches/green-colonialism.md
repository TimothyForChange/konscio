excerpt: "The DRC's cobalt fuels the world's ‘green' technologies, but the price is paid by its people and ecosystems. The so-called transition repeats colonial extraction — unless power itself is transformed."

# Green Colonialism: The DRC and the Green Transition

The Democratic Republic of Congo is treated not as a country but as a resource — a seam of minerals awaiting extraction.

Cobalt for batteries, coltan for phones, lithium for storage: the "green transition" is sold as salvation through technology.
Yet behind every electric vehicle and solar panel lies the same old structure — the South supplies, the North profits.

This is not progress. It is **colonialism with new branding.**

## Old Empire, New Language

The Congo has long been a test site for empire.
From Leopold's terror to today's supply chains, the method is constant: control resources, cheapen labour, extract value.
Only the vocabulary evolves — _civilisation_ becomes _development_, _extraction_ becomes _sustainability_.

> "The Congo Free State was not a colony but the world's only private colony — the personal possession of a single individual."
> — Adam Hochschild, King Leopold's Ghost (1998)

Now, multinational firms and governments use the language of climate urgency to justify the same system.

## The Extraction Logic of the "Green" Transition

The Global North's shift to renewable energy demands unprecedented mineral inputs.
It is framed as moral necessity, but the supply chains run through coercion.

- **Cobalt dependency:** The DRC supplies about 70% of global cobalt. Less than 5% is refined locally.
- **Foreign dominance:** Chinese, Western, and Gulf capital hold most stakes. Ownership changes; hierarchy persists.
- **Built-in instability:** Conflict and corruption keep prices low and oversight weak.
- **Greenwashing:** Mines are declared "critical for the transition" — absolving exploitation as virtue.

A ton of raw cobalt exported earns a fraction of what refined cobalt does abroad.
The profits leave; the pollution stays.

## The Human and Ecological Cost

Mining zones reveal the price of "sustainability":

- Rivers poisoned by mercury and acid runoff.
- Children digging ore in open pits.
- Villages displaced to expand concessions.
- Forests clear-cut across the Congo Basin — a carbon sink storing billions of tonnes of CO₂.

Each battery carries invisible emissions from deforestation, shipping, and refining.
The world's green future is being mined from black earth.

## Toward Democratic Control

A just transition demands democratic control of both production and ecology.

**Principles for change:**

1. Public and community ownership of mining and refining.
2. Local value-addition and industrialisation within Africa.
3. Strict ecological limits and transparent oversight.
4. Reparations and technology transfer from the North to the South.
5. Global solidarity between workers and communities resisting extraction.

The question is not whether the planet decarbonises, but **who controls that process and who benefits.**

---

## Resistance from Below

Change is already rooted in struggle:

- Civil society groups in Lualaba forcing compensation for pollution.
- Local cooperatives bargaining for fairer pricing.
- Environmental defenders halting illegal concessions.

These acts, though local, point toward a global demand: control must return to those who live with the consequences.

## Beyond Greenwashing

True climate justice requires dismantling the economic architecture that makes exploitation appear sustainable.

A battery produced through dispossession is not clean energy.
It's a continuation of the old order — empire under a new colour scheme.
