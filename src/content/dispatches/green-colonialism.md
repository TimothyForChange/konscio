# Green Colonialism: The DRC and the Green Transition

The Democratic Republic of Congo is treated not as a nation but as a reservoir — a seam of minerals, forests, and water waiting to be extracted. Cobalt for batteries, coltan for phones, lithium for storage: the so-called green transition of the Global North depends on Congolese land and labour. Yet the benefits flow outward while the costs remain local.

This is not progress. It is colonialism with new branding — green on the outside, extractive at its core.

## Old Empire, New Language

From the Congo Free State to modern supply chains, the logic is constant: control resources, cheapen labour, extract value. Only the vocabulary changes.
“Civilisation” becomes “development.”
“Extraction” becomes “sustainability.”
“Resource security” becomes “climate leadership.”

And now, under the banner of climate urgency, multinational corporations and foreign governments frame the DRC as indispensable to the world's clean energy future — while keeping Congolese people at the bottom of that future's hierarchy.

## The Extraction Logic of the Green Transition

The Global North's shift to renewable energy requires unprecedented mineral inputs. Demand projections for cobalt and copper are skyrocketing. But the supply chains are structured to maximise extraction and minimise local control.

Key patterns include:

- **Extreme dependency:** The DRC supplies ~70% of global cobalt. Less than a fraction is refined locally.
- **Foreign ownership:** Chinese, Western, and Gulf capital dominate concessions. Ownership shifts; hierarchy stays.
- **Perpetual instability:** Conflict, corruption, and weak regulation keep prices low and oversight impossible.
- **Greenwashing:** Mines are declared “critical to the energy transition,” absolving exploitation as planetary virtue.

A ton of raw cobalt earns almost nothing in-country compared to its refined value abroad. The profits leave. The pollution stays.

## Human and Ecological Costs

Behind every battery and solar panel lies devastation:

- Rivers poisoned by mercury, acid, and tailings.
- Open-pit mines expanding into farmland and villages.
- Children and artisanal miners working without protection.
- The Congo Basin — one of Earth's great carbon sinks — carved up for concessions.
- Deforestation accelerating to feed both mining and logging.

The world's green transition is being mined from black earth, with Congolese communities forced to absorb the ecological fallout.

## The Mirage of ESG Responsibility

Western governments and corporations claim their supply chains are “ethical,” “responsible,” or “transparent.” Yet audits repeatedly find:

- subcontractors using forced and child labour,
- falsified certification documents,
- “clean” supply chains contaminated by illicit ore,
- and ESG standards designed without local input.

Responsibility becomes a marketing label — not a material change.

## Toward Democratic Control

A just transition demands that Congo's resources serve Congo first. That requires:

- **Public and community ownership** of mining and refining.
- **Local value addition** — keeping processing and manufacturing inside the region.
- **Strict ecological limits** and transparent oversight.
- **Technology transfer and reparative climate finance** from the North.
- **Regional coordination** to prevent divide-and-conquer tactics by multinationals.

Climate justice means sovereignty over resources — not new forms of dependency.

## Resistance From Below

Communities across Lualaba, Haut-Katanga, and North Kivu are fighting back:

- Civil society groups force compensation for pollution.
- Miners' cooperatives negotiate fairer prices.
- Environmental defenders challenge illegal concessions.
- Youth organisations expose land grabs and logging crimes.

These struggles point toward a different transition — one built on justice, not sacrifice zones.

## Beyond Greenwashing

A battery produced through dispossession is not clean energy.
A solar panel sitting on stolen land is not climate justice.
A transition that relies on colonial extraction simply repaints the old order.

True climate solutions must dismantle the political economy that made the DRC a site of extraction in the first place — not reproduce it under a greener slogan.
