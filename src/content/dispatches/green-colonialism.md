# Green Colonialism: The DRC and the Green Transition

The Democratic Republic of Congo is presented to the world as a resource: a seam of minerals waiting for extraction, refinement, and shipment.

In radio spots, corporate reports, and policy papers this is framed as progress: cobalt for batteries, coltan for phones, lithium for storage — a curated narrative of salvation through consumption.

Look closer and the "green transition" championed by the Global North becomes a new vocabulary for an old practice — extracting wealth from the Global South while leaving devastation in its wake.

This is not a tale of resource scarcity. It is about **who controls the minerals**, who captures the value, and who absorbs the social and ecological cost. It is, in short, a story about power.

## Colonial Patterns in Contemporary Extraction

The violent patterns seen in the DRC today are not anomalies that emerged after independence; they are continuities of a long history. The Congo was central to European imperial plunder, a landscape commodified under Leopold II's rule where extraction and brutality were the political economy. That logic did not die with formal empire; it mutated.

> As Adam Hochschild writes in King Leopold's Ghost (1998), the Congo Free State was "not a colony but the world's only private colony — the personal possession of a single individual."

Contemporary extraction follows the same blueprint: external demand sets the terms, local governance is weakened or co-opted, and violence — economic, political, and physical — enforces supply. Minerals are turned into global commodities; communities are reduced to labour pools or obstacles to be removed. Language changes, but the operation remains recognisably colonial.

## The Extraction Imperative Behind Green Technologies

The Global North's shift to "green" technologies requires vast quantities of specific minerals. This demand is framed as urgent and moral: save the planet by switching to electric vehicles and renewable systems. But moralising the commodity does not alter the politics of its production. A few structural points to note:

- **Supply chains concentrate value outside the DRC.** The country supplies roughly **70% of global cobalt** production, yet under **5%** is refined locally. Raw extraction is low-paid and ecologically destructive, while most value is captured further along the chain — refining, component manufacturing, final branding — largely beyond African borders. A tonne of refined cobalt can fetch twenty times the price of the raw ore leaving Congolese ports.
- **Actors of accumulation are transnational.** Mining firms, traders, smelters and financiers — headquartered in the Global North or Beijing, Dubai and other corporate hubs — structure the market: they set prices and labour standards. Chinese state and private companies now control roughly **80%** of Congolese cobalt output, illustrating how capital continues colonial extraction under new management.
- **Instability is engineered as a profit condition.** Weak governance and contested territories help secure concessions, favourable contracts and control over informal economies. What is framed as a humanitarian crisis functions as a market strategy.
- **Green rhetoric masks continuity.** Label a mine "critical for the energy transition" and the social and ecological violence is sanitised; consumers and states in the Global North are absolved of responsibility.

The result is a peculiar inversion: the rhetoric of environmental stewardship facilitates extraction regimes that threaten the very ecosystems and communities supposedly being protected.

## The Human and Ecological Realities of Extraction

Extraction in the DRC is not an abstract policy problem; it is embodied in human lives and in the region's ecology. Communities living near mines report destroyed farmland, polluted waterways, and shattered livelihoods. Informal and artisanal miners operate under precarious and hazardous conditions, with women and children disproportionately exposed to risk. These social harms are compounded by militarisation: armed groups, private militias, and state security forces often contest control over mines and transport routes.

At the same time, the **Congo Basin rainforest** — a vital carbon sink and one of the world's last great biodiversity reserves — faces mounting pressure from industrial encroachment. Forest degradation, soil erosion, and contamination from mining chemicals cause ecological damage that spreads far beyond local communities.

The carbon arithmetic reveals the contradiction: the Congo Basin stores approximately **8 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent**, yet mining for "green" technologies accelerates deforestation and releases stored carbon. Each electric vehicle battery requires roughly **8 kg** of cobalt; its full lifecycle — from forest clearing to mine construction to processing — can emit more carbon early on than the device will offset for several years. The Global North's climate "solutions" become the Global South's climate accelerants.

Ecocide here emerges as a by-product of a model that translates natural commons into private profit, rather than merely collateral damage.

## Local Resistance and Community Power

Despite the bleak picture, the story is not only one of victimhood. Congolese workers, community organisers, environmental defenders, and local movements are resisting in diverse ways: organising for safer conditions and fair pay, pushing for community control over resources, documenting abuses, and contesting illegitimate concessions.

**Victories are possible.** In 2019, communities in Lualaba Province successfully challenged Chinese company Sicomines over environmental damage and forced compensation payments. The **Observatoire Congolais des Droits de l'Homme (OCDH)** has documented mining abuses and forced several firms to improve safety conditions. Artisanal miners' cooperatives have secured better prices by organising collectively rather than selling to individual middlemen. In 2023, civil society pressure led to the suspension of several mining licenses pending environmental impact assessments.

These struggles demonstrate that power can be challenged even in the most difficult circumstances. They show that change is possible when communities organise, document abuse, and demand accountability. International solidarity must centre these struggles rather than speak for them. Our role — as readers, activists, and consumers in the Global North — is to shift attention and power toward those who live the consequences and demand alternatives.

What would a different approach look like?

- **Local sovereignty over resources:** Communities and nations must have genuine control over how resources are used and who benefits, not token consultation or cut-price concessions.
- **Value added locally:** Building refining, processing, and manufacturing capacity in the Global South breaks the pattern of raw extraction for foreign profit, creates decent jobs, and retains more value locally.
- **Supply chain accountability:** Buyers and states must be held responsible for the human and ecological conditions of production, not merely for sourcing "conflict-free" minerals in name.
- **A just transition that is not colonial:** If the energy transition is to be ethical, it cannot rely on new waves of extraction that reproduce colonial patterns. Justice must be non-negotiable — for workers, communities, and ecosystems.

## Reconsidering Our Role and Responsibility

It is tempting to see the DRC as a tragic exception or a governance failure to be fixed by technical solutions. That view is convenient because it lets consumers and policymakers imagine that swapping suppliers, auditing mines, or buying "ethical" labels is sufficient. It is not.

If we are serious about planetary survival and social justice, the green transition must include **structural shifts in political economy**: redistribution of power, democratic control of resources, and reparative responsibilities from those who have historically profited from extraction.

We must also confront our own demand. Technologies do not appear out of thin air; they are the product of choices. Those choices have consequences we are obliged to reckon with.

## Concrete Steps for Meaningful Solidarity

If you want to act in meaningful solidarity, here are immediate, politically coherent steps:

- **Centre Congolese voices.** Read and circulate analysis written by Congolese activists, scholars and community groups. Amplify demands rather than narrating suffering.
- **Support community-led organisations.** Prioritise funding and attention for grassroots groups advancing labour rights, environmental defence and local governance.
- **Hold corporations and states accountable.** Demand transparent supply chains, local value addition, reparative funds and binding liability for ecological and labour harms.
- **Demand policy change.** Campaign for trade, aid and investment rules that do not privilege extractive profit over human and ecological rights.

## Beyond Pity: Toward Structural Change

The Congo requires the end of a system that makes its land and labour profitable for others, rather than our pity. It needs international responsibility that recognises historical injustice and refuses to replace old forms of extraction with new ones under green branding.

If the green transition is to mean anything, it must begin by dismantling the extractive relations that have long defined the Congo's place in the world economy. Anything less is continuity in new clothes.
