# Black Gold and Red Soil: Russia’s Africa Corps and the New Imperial Extraction

> “For the master’s tool will never dismantle the master’s house.”
> — Audre Lorde (1979)

The Russian flag now flies over gold mines in the Central African Republic.
But this is not conquest by armies — it is conquest by contracts, carried out by mercenaries in camouflage and suits in Moscow boardrooms.

After Wagner’s fall the Kremlin’s **Africa Corps** took its place.
Its mission is not peacekeeping nor ideology. It is extraction: gold, diamonds, timber — transmuted into hard currency for wars abroad and patronage at home.

Africa again becomes the cash machine of empire.

## From Wagner to Africa Corps: The Seamless Mutation of Imperial Muscle

Wagner’s African operations were never freelance; they were the informal wing of Russian foreign policy — projecting power without formal accountability.

When Yevgeny Prigozhin died and Wagner fractured, Moscow changed the label. The **Africa Corps**, run through Russia’s Defence Ministry and intelligence networks, absorbed Wagner’s personnel, mines and shell companies.

In the **Central African Republic (CAR)** this meant business as usual. Wagner’s Midas Resources still controls the **Ndassima gold mine**, fighters now wearing Africa Corps insignia. Diamonds move through **Diamville**, timber through **Bois Rouge**, and money through offshore accounts and refineries in Dubai and Moscow.

This is Russia’s Africa policy stripped bare: **war financed by resource extraction**. What was framed as “private” is now state‑backed looting with bureaucratic discipline.

## Resource-for-Security: A Colonial Contract

The logic is brutally simple. Russia offers “security assistance” — weapons, training, a few hundred soldiers to guard the palace. In return Moscow‑linked firms receive **mining concessions**.

In the CAR the model is formalised: gold and timber as payment for “security cooperation.” In **Mali** and **Sudan** Wagner and successors offer the same deal. Pattern: **guns for gold; propaganda for legitimacy**.

CAR’s government, broke and besieged, now owes survival to Moscow — sovereignty mortgaged to a foreign army whose loyalty lies with profit, not peace.

This is **colonialism without colonists** — extraction outsourced, empire subcontracted.

---

## Blood in the Soil: Violence as Economic Infrastructure

The mines are not workplaces; they are war zones.

Satellite imagery and rights reports show villages razed around Ndassima. Locals describe forced labour, sexual violence and extortion at checkpoints.

Where the Corps moves, forests are stripped, rivers poisoned by mercury, communities displaced. Mercenaries are not a symptom of insecurity — they are its architecture.

Gold bars become bullets in Ukraine.
Diamonds fund disinformation.
Each extraction site is a microcosm of a global structure: **African resources financing European wars.**

---

## Smuggling, Sanctions, and the Mirage of Sovereignty

Russia’s economic isolation after the Ukraine invasion made African gold more than trophy — it is lifeline.
Via African intermediaries, Russian‑linked companies move bullion through **Dubai**, **Istanbul** and **Hong Kong**, bypassing sanctions.

Official CAR statistics are fiction; production figures vanish into informal channels.
Dubai refineries process hundreds of tonnes of untraceable gold yearly — much from conflict zones.

The Kremlin’s war chest is filled with metal dug by men who will never see a rouble. It is **imperial recycling**: Africa’s gold props up Russia’s wars while Russia props up regimes that enable looting.

## A Pattern Across the Continent

The Africa Corps is not confined to CAR.

- **Mali:** Russian mercenaries replace French forces, securing mining zones for concessions. Villages near Mopti and Gao bombed or depopulated under counterterrorism guise.
- **Sudan:** Wagner affiliates trained RSF units and helped move gold to Russia during civil war — mirroring the CAR model.
- **Burkina Faso & Niger:** Russian envoys promise identical formula — protection from jihadists paid in natural resources.

This network is an **imperial economy of insecurity**, feeding Moscow’s foreign policy and the continent’s crisis industry.

## Empire’s Continuum: From Washington to Moscow

This is not uniquely Russian. It is the same extractive logic practised by France, Britain, the United States and China — a rotating cast of imperial patrons.

Russia’s entry reveals continuity: **whoever has capital and guns dictates extraction terms.**
From the Niger Delta to the Donbas, from Gaza to Ndassima, empire’s syntax is unchanged: plunder justified as “stability”.

The difference is rhetorical, not structural. Where the West speaks of “development”, Moscow speaks of “security”. Both mean **control over land, labour and life**.

---

## Resistance and Reckoning

Yet resistance persists.

In Bangui activists document abuses despite threats. In Mali trade unions condemn resource‑for‑security deals as “theft in uniform”. In South Africa solidarity movements call for sanctions on Dubai refineries and transparency in gold trade.

These movements name what many Western analysts avoid: **extractivism is war by economic means.**

Solidarity must move beyond moral outrage to **material disruption**:

- Expose refineries laundering stolen gold.
- Target shipping firms and financiers greasing transactions.
- Back community control over resources — not military “protection”.

Without this material disruption, every anti‑imperialist speech is hollow.

## Toward a Decolonial Future

The Africa Corps story is not merely about Russia; it exposes a planetary extractive order that still treats Africa as feedstock for distant wars and balance sheets.
Unless extraction itself is delegitimised — not just the flag atop the concession — the continent remains theatre for interchangeable empires.

As **Walter Rodney** reminded us, underdevelopment is a relationship — persisting in gold dust laundered through Dubai, scorched villages near Ndassima and the manufactured illusion of sovereignty secured by foreign guns.

Breaking it means centring life over loot: dismantling financial, logistical and security circuits that convert forests and rivers into munitions and propaganda; building collective stewardship and mutual survival that make mercenary bargaining impossible.

Africa’s soil is not Russia’s treasury, not France’s legacy, not China’s factory floor. It is living ground — bloodied yet capable of regeneration if shielded from imperial machinery.

Solidarity with communities resisting at Ndassima, Mopti, El Fasher and all sites where land is defended against extraction’s armed custodians.
