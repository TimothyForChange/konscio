# Black Gold and Red Soil: Russia’s Africa Corps and the New Imperial Extraction

> "For the master’s tool will never dismantle the master’s house."
> — Audre Lorde (1979)

The Russian flag now flies over gold mines in the Central African Republic.
But this is not conquest by armies — it is conquest by contracts, carried out by mercenaries in camouflage and suits in Moscow boardrooms.

After Wagner’s fall the Kremlin’s **Africa Corps** took its place.[^1]
Its mission is not peacekeeping nor ideology. It is extraction: gold, diamonds, timber — transmuted into hard currency for wars abroad and patronage at home.

Africa again becomes the cash machine of empire.

## From Wagner to Africa Corps: The Seamless Mutation of Imperial Muscle

Wagner’s African operations were never freelance; they were the informal wing of Russian foreign policy — projecting power without formal accountability.[^2][^8]

When Yevgeny Prigozhin died and Wagner fractured, Moscow changed the label. The **Africa Corps**, run through Russia’s Defence Ministry and intelligence networks, absorbed Wagner’s personnel, mines and shell companies.[^1][^8]

In the **Central African Republic (CAR)** this meant business as usual. Wagner’s Midas Resources still controls the **Ndassima gold mine**, fighters now wearing Africa Corps insignia.[^2][^3] Diamonds move through **Diamville**, timber through **Bois Rouge**, and money through offshore accounts and refineries in Dubai and Moscow.[^2][^6]

This is Russia’s Africa policy stripped bare: **war financed by resource extraction**. What was framed as "private" is now state-backed looting with bureaucratic discipline.[^8][^9]

---

## Resource-for-Security: A Colonial Contract

The logic is brutally simple. Russia offers "security assistance" — weapons, training, a few hundred soldiers to guard the palace. In return Moscow-linked firms receive **mining concessions**.[^2][^8][^9]

In the CAR the model is formalised: gold and timber as payment for "security cooperation." In **Mali** and **Sudan** Wagner and successors offer the same deal. Pattern: **guns for gold; propaganda for legitimacy**.[^4][^5][^7]

CAR’s government, broke and besieged, now owes survival to Moscow — sovereignty mortgaged to a foreign army whose loyalty lies with profit, not peace.[^2][^8]

This is **colonialism without colonists** — extraction outsourced, empire subcontracted.

---

## Blood in the Soil: Violence as Economic Infrastructure

The mines are not workplaces; they are war zones.

Satellite imagery and rights reports show villages razed around Ndassima. Locals describe forced labour, sexual violence and extortion at checkpoints.[^4][^5][^10]

Where the Corps moves, forests are stripped, rivers poisoned by mercury, communities displaced. Mercenaries are not a symptom of insecurity — they are its architecture.[^6][^9]

Gold bars become bullets in Ukraine.
Diamonds fund disinformation.
Each extraction site is a microcosm of a global structure: **African resources financing European wars.**

---

## Smuggling, Sanctions, and the Mirage of Sovereignty

Russia’s economic isolation after the Ukraine invasion made African gold more than trophy — it is lifeline.[^9]
Via African intermediaries, Russian-linked companies move bullion through **Dubai**, **Istanbul** and **Hong Kong**, bypassing sanctions.[^2]

Official CAR statistics are fiction; production figures vanish into informal channels.[^9]
Dubai refineries process hundreds of tonnes of untraceable gold yearly — much from conflict zones.

The Kremlin’s war chest is filled with metal dug by men who will never see a rouble. It is **imperial recycling**: Africa’s gold props up Russia’s wars while Russia props up regimes that enable looting.[^2][^9]

---

## A Pattern Across the Continent

The Africa Corps is not confined to CAR.

- **Mali:** Russian mercenaries replace French forces, securing mining zones for concessions. Villages near Mopti and Gao bombed or depopulated under counterterrorism guise.[^4][^10]
- **Sudan:** Wagner affiliates trained RSF units and helped move gold to Russia during civil war — mirroring the CAR model.[^7][^5]
- **Burkina Faso & Niger:** Russian envoys promise identical formula — protection from jihadists paid in natural resources.[^4][^8]

This network is an **imperial economy of insecurity**, feeding Moscow’s foreign policy and the continent’s crisis industry.[^8][^9]

## Empire’s Continuum: From Washington to Moscow

This is not uniquely Russian. It is the same extractive logic practised by France, Britain, the United States and China — a rotating cast of imperial patrons.[^9]

Russia’s entry reveals continuity: **whoever has capital and guns dictates extraction terms.**
From the Niger Delta to the Donbas, from Gaza to Ndassima, empire’s syntax is unchanged: plunder justified as "stability".

The difference is rhetorical, not structural. Where the West speaks of "development", Moscow speaks of "security". Both mean **control over land, labour and life**.[^9]

---

## Resistance and Reckoning

Yet resistance persists.

In Bangui activists document abuses despite threats. In Mali trade unions condemn resource-for-security deals as "theft in uniform". In South Africa solidarity movements call for sanctions on Dubai refineries and transparency in gold trade.[^10]

These movements name what many Western analysts avoid: **extractivism is war by economic means.**

Solidarity must move beyond moral outrage to **material disruption**:

- Expose refineries laundering stolen gold.
- Target shipping firms and financiers greasing transactions.
- Back community control over resources — not military "protection".

Without this material disruption, every anti-imperialist speech is hollow.[^9]

## Toward a Decolonial Future

The Africa Corps story is not merely about Russia; it exposes a planetary extractive order that still treats Africa as feedstock for distant wars and balance sheets.
Unless extraction itself is delegitimised — not just the flag atop the concession — the continent remains theatre for interchangeable empires.

As **Walter Rodney** reminded us, underdevelopment is a relationship — persisting in gold dust laundered through Dubai, scorched villages near Ndassima and the manufactured illusion of sovereignty secured by foreign guns.[^9]

Breaking it means centring life over loot: dismantling financial, logistical and security circuits that convert forests and rivers into munitions and propaganda; building collective stewardship and mutual survival that make mercenary bargaining impossible.

Africa’s soil is not Russia’s treasury, not France’s legacy, not China’s factory floor. It is living ground — bloodied yet capable of regeneration if shielded from imperial machinery.

Solidarity with communities resisting at Ndassima, Mopti, El Fasher and all sites where land is defended against extraction’s armed custodians.
