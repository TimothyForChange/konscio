# Black Gold and Red Soil: Russia’s Africa Corps and the New Imperial Extraction

> "For the master's tool will never dismantle the master's house."
> — Audre Lorde (1979)

The Russian flag now flies over gold mines in the Central African Republic.
But this is not conquest by armies — it is conquest by contracts, carried out by mercenaries in camouflage and suits in Moscow boardrooms.

After Wagner’s fall the Kremlin’s **Africa Corps** took its place. Its mission is not peacekeeping nor ideology. It is extraction: gold, diamonds, timber — transmuted into hard currency for wars abroad and patronage at home.

Africa again becomes the cash machine of empire.

## From Wagner to Africa Corps: The Seamless Mutation of Imperial Muscle

Wagner's African operations were never freelance; they were the informal wing of Russian foreign policy — projecting power without formal accountability. When Yevgeny Prigozhin died and Wagner fractured, Moscow reconstituted the apparatus into state-linked structures that could absorb personnel, networks and concession deals.

In the **Central African Republic (CAR)** this meant business as usual. Mining concessions changed hands; companies with murky ownership took control of Ndassima and other deposits. Fighters in new uniforms continue to guard extraction sites while commodity flows move to refiners and offshore accounts.

This is Russia’s Africa policy stripped bare: security in exchange for access to resources.

---

## Resource-for-Security: A Colonial Contract

The logic is brutally simple. Russia offers “security assistance” — weapons, training, and paramilitary presence. In return, Moscow-linked firms receive mining concessions and privileged contracts.

In the CAR, gold, diamonds and timber are the currency of patronage. This pattern replicates across Mali, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Niger: **guns for gold; protection for concessions.**

This is colonialism without colonists — extraction outsourced, empire subcontracted.

---

## Blood in the Soil: Violence as Economic Infrastructure

Mines are not benign workplaces; they are contested zones where violence enforces profit.

Reports document forced labour, extortion, sexual violence and displacement around extraction sites. Satellite imagery shows villages razed and rutted access roads. Rivers bear mercury and sediment from unregulated artisanal mining.

Where the Corps moves, ecologies are damaged and communities are terrorised. Gold bars become bullets; mineral wealth funds conflict, disinformation and patronage networks.

---

## Smuggling, Sanctions and the Mirage of Sovereignty

Russia’s post-Ukraine isolation made African gold more than loot — it became lifeline. Through intermediaries, bullion moves from African mines to refineries in **Dubai**, **Istanbul** and elsewhere, evading sanctions and laundering the origin.

Official production figures rarely match reality. Informal trade networks and state complicit actors obscure flows. Offshore firms and shell companies convert local riches into fungible capital for global politics.

It is imperial recycling: Africa’s resources underwrite fights elsewhere; authoritarian capital buys legitimacy and weapons.

---

## A Pattern Across the Continent

The Africa Corps is one node in a larger extractive system:

- **Mali:** Russian actors fill gaps left by former colonial security arrangements, securing concessions and influence.
- **Sudan:** Wagner-linked advisers and networks have helped open gold corridors.
- **Burkina Faso & Niger:** New security pacts often come with concession opportunities.

Whatever the flag, the economic logic is constant: capital and coercion combine to carve out resource rents.

---

## Empire’s Continuum: From Washington to Moscow

This is not uniquely Russian. France, Britain, the U.S., China and Gulf actors have long practised similar extraction-through-security approaches. The actors rotate; the system persists.

The difference is rhetorical. Some invoke development; others invoke security. Both produce dispossession.

---

## Democratic Socialist Response

A democratic socialist approach rejects imperial bargaining — East or West — and centres democratic control, transparency and community rights.

Policy demands include:

- **Expose and sanction** supply chains laundering illicit commodity flows.
- **Support community governance** and legal recognition of collective land rights.
- **End “resource-for-security” deals** with binding international norms.
- **Back regional oversight** and grassroots accountability for contracts and military assistance.

We should treat extraction as public rather than private infrastructure: revenue should fund health, education and reconstruction — not patronage and foreign wars.

---

## Resistance and Organising

Resistance takes many forms: community mapping of concessions, unionisation of miners, local watchdog journalism and transnational solidarity campaigns targeting refineries and shipping lines.

Solidarity must be material: sanction laundering networks, block logistics chains used to export plunder, and build alternatives — cooperatives, public mineral companies under democratic oversight.

Africa’s soil is not a treasury for empires. It is living ground, and democratic control is the path to reclaiming it.

— In solidarity with communities resisting extraction and militarised control.
