# Black Gold and Red Soil: Russia's Africa Corps and the New Imperial Extraction

> "For the master's tool will never dismantle the master's house."
> — Audre Lorde (1979)

The Russian flag now flies over gold mines in the Central African Republic.
But this is not conquest by armies — it is conquest by contracts, enforced by mercenaries and brokers.

After Wagner's collapse, the Kremlin reconstituted its African networks under a new name: the Africa Corps. Its mission is extraction — gold, diamonds, timber — converted into hard currency for wars abroad and patronage at home.

Once again, Africa's soil bankrolls empire.

## From Wagner to Africa Corps: The Mutation of Power

Wagner's African operations were never rogue enterprises. They were the informal wing of Russian state power, projecting influence through deniable force. When Yevgeny Prigozhin died, Moscow simply absorbed the apparatus into state-linked structures.

In the Central African Republic, little changed. Mining concessions shifted on paper; guards changed insignias. The logic remained: security for access, soldiers for mines.

This is Russia's Africa policy stripped to its core — coercion exchanged for concession.

---

## Resource-for-Security: The Colonial Contract Reborn

The deal is simple. Russia provides arms, training, and paramilitaries; in return, its companies secure rights to gold, diamonds, or timber.

In CAR, Mali, Sudan, Burkina Faso, and Niger, this pattern repeats: guns for gold, protection for profit.
It is colonialism without colonists — empire subcontracted.

---

## Violence as Economic Infrastructure

Mines are militarised zones. Reports document forced labour, extortion, sexual violence, and village displacement.
Satellite images reveal scorched settlements and polluted rivers.
Gold becomes weaponry; the environment becomes collateral.

Where the Africa Corps moves, soil and society are both stripped. Extraction funds repression abroad and authoritarianism at home.

---

## Smuggling, Sanctions, and the Mirage of Sovereignty

Russia's isolation after the Ukraine invasion made African gold more than a commodity — it became lifeline.
Through intermediaries, bullion moves from African mines to refineries in Dubai and Istanbul, evading sanctions and obscuring origin.

Official figures tell little. Shell firms, offshore accounts, and pliant local elites conceal the true flows. The result is imperial recycling: African resources turned into geopolitical capital.

---

## A Pattern Beyond Moscow

This is not uniquely Russian.
Western, Chinese, and Gulf actors use the same method: exchange military support or infrastructure for mineral access.
The branding differs — "development," "security," "stability" — but the structure is constant: capital backed by coercion.

## Toward Democratic and Ecological Accountability

The answer is not new alignments but new principles: transparency, public ownership, and ecological responsibility.

To break the extractive cycle, states and communities must reclaim control over natural wealth.

Priorities include:

- Enforce transparency in all concession and resource-for-security deals.
- Support community governance and legal recognition of collective land rights.
- Sanction networks laundering illicit commodity flows through refineries and intermediaries.
- Treat extraction revenues as public infrastructure — funding health, education, and ecological repair, not patronage or foreign wars.

Extraction should serve life, not empire.

## Resistance and Renewal

Resistance is already underway: miners organising for rights, journalists exposing illicit flows, activists tracing the links between smuggling and state corruption.

Solidarity must be practical — targeting logistics, financial networks, and the narratives that normalise exploitation.

Africa's red soil is living ground, not collateral.
Democratic control — over land, labour, and life — remains the surest defence against empire.

— In solidarity with communities resisting extraction and militarised power.
