# Black Gold and Red Soil: Russia's Africa Corps and the New Imperial Extraction

After Wagner's collapse, the Kremlin reassembled its African operations under a new banner: the Africa Corps. The name changed, but the project remained the same — secure mines, extract resources, and convert Africa's wealth into geopolitical capital for Russia's wars and patronage networks.

_This is not partnership. It is extraction enforced through militarised outsourcing._

## From Wagner to Africa Corps: The Mutation of Power

Wagner's African missions were never rogue. They were an unofficial arm of the Russian state — a deniable extension of power. When Prigozhin died, Moscow absorbed his networks, rebranded them, and placed them under tighter state control.

In the Central African Republic, Mali, Niger, and Sudan:

- The guards changed insignias,
- Contracts were rewritten,
- But the structure of coercion stayed.

_The Africa Corps is simply empire with new paperwork._

## Resource-for-Security: The Colonial Contract Reborn

The deal offered to governments is blunt:

**Security, weapons, and paramilitaries in exchange for gold, diamonds, timber, and political loyalty.**

The Africa Corps is simply empire with new paperwork.

This model mirrors earlier colonial arrangements:

- Force in place of governance,
- Extraction in place of development,
- Patronage in place of sovereignty.

In CAR, gold concessions such as Ndassima have been effectively militarised zones where mining and war converge.

---

## Violence as Economic Infrastructure

Extraction under the Africa Corps is inseparable from violence:

- Villages are displaced to secure concessions.
- Sexual violence and forced labour accompany mining operations.
- Satellite evidence reveals scorched-earth tactics near resource sites.
- Local journalists and activists are threatened or disappeared.

Wherever the Africa Corps expands, soil and society are stripped together.

## Smuggling, Sanctions, and the Global Market

Sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine made African gold more valuable than ever. Smuggled bullion is laundered through:

- Dubai,
- Istanbul,
- offshore firms,
- and informal networks involving local elites.

_Gold becomes a lifeline for Russia's war economy._
_African wealth becomes geopolitical oxygen._

---

## More Than Moscow

Russia is not unique. Western, Chinese, and Gulf actors use near-identical methods: loans or security in exchange for mineral access, often through opaque concessions.

The branding changes — “development,” “stability,” “win-win” — but the structure does not. Africa's resources are treated as inputs for foreign power, not foundations for local prosperity.

---

## Toward Democratic and Ecological Accountability

Breaking this cycle requires:

- transparency for all contracts and concessions,
- community land rights with legal enforcement,
- sanctions on smuggling networks and refineries,
- and treating resource revenues as public wealth for health, education, and environmental repair.

_Extraction should serve life — not foreign wars or domestic elites._

---

## Resistance and Renewal

Courageous resistance exists:

- miners organising for wage justice,
- journalists exposing illicit shipments,
- civil society groups defending forests and communities,
- regional coalitions challenging resource-for-security deals.

_Democratic control over land and labour remains the surest defence against militarised extraction._

---

## Red Soil, Black Gold

Africa's red soil is living ground — not collateral in a geopolitical auction.
A just future requires stripping away the myths of partnership and confronting the reality: extraction backed by force is still empire.

_Only democratic ownership can turn Africa's wealth into a foundation for dignity instead of a weapon for foreign ambitions._
