# Health Is Not a Privilege: Why South Africa Needs the NHI

Every day South Africans queue for hours in understaffed clinics. Mothers sleep upright beside beds because wards are overcrowded. Nurses work double shifts with broken equipment and scant protection. This is not bad luck or "inefficiency". It is structural violence: survival pegged to income; poverty punished with illness and death — engineered through distribution of resources.

The National Health Insurance (NHI) is not technocratic reform; it is a moral test of the post‑apartheid settlement.

## The Unfinished Struggle for Health Justice

The divide between public and private care proves apartheid never ended — it was financialised. Segregated services became bifurcated systems: one for the insured minority; one for everyone else. The rich migrated to medical aid schemes padded by tax breaks; the poor were left to queue in collapsing facilities.

Inequality has deepened. Private hospitals absorb nearly half of national health spending while serving under 20 percent of people. The public system serves the majority with what remains — an economic map matching apartheid geography: resourced suburbs versus neglected townships and rural districts.

Signed into law in May 2024, the NHI promises to pool public and private funds into one national system. Entitlement to quality care would no longer hinge on income or postcode. It is the most ambitious social reform since 1994 — one of the few capable of making the Constitution’s promise of "health for all" material.

## Who Opposes It and Why

Power does not surrender profit. The loudest critics are those enriched by the two‑tier system. Private hospital corporations, medical aid administrators and political allies warn the NHI will "collapse healthcare" or "chase away doctors". What they fear is not collapse — but equity.

Business lobbies call it "unaffordable" — meaning unaffordable for them. The same voices cheering corporate tax cuts discover fiscal prudence when redistribution appears. Discovery Health spends millions marketing yet cries poverty when asked to share. Treasury invokes "growth constraints" while austerity itself strangles growth.

Liberal opposition cloaks defence of privilege in moral language — "freedom of choice". In a country where most cannot afford medical aid that "choice" is a fiction. Warnings of a "Cuban‑style monopoly" invert reality: they shield an existing private monopoly turning suffering into profit.

Healthcare must not depend on market generosity; it must rest on human dignity.

## What the NHI Promises

Core idea: universal coverage through pooled funding. Citizens contribute via progressive taxation instead of private premiums; a national fund purchases services from public and private providers.

This model offers major gains when done well:

- **Equity:** Care according to need, not income.
- **Efficiency:** Centralised purchasing cuts duplication and waste.
- **Solidarity:** The healthy support the sick; everyone will need care.
- **Decolonisation:** Ends the colonial logic reserving world‑class medicine for the rich.

Universal healthcare is not charity; it is collective dignity. Illness is social — shaped by poverty, pollution and work. The NHI institutionalises that truth.

## The Challenges Ahead

Still, no illusion is useful. The NHI faces serious obstacles.

**State capacity** is fragile. Corruption, mismanagement and low morale have hollowed the public system. Passing a law is easier than running a hospital.
Infrastructure upgrades, staff recruitment, and transparent procurement will take sustained commitment.

**Fiscal constraint** is real yet political. Treasury resists wealth taxes and prefers austerity while billions leak via profit‑shifting, elite bailouts and wasteful defence spending. South Africa lacks redistribution, not resources.

**Administrative complexity**: vast data systems for records, payments and accreditation. Outsourcing to private vendors invites corruption. Build open, auditable, locally controlled systems.

**Legal resistance**: private companies preparing constitutional challenges to defend market share and slow implementation.

All these challenges are surmountable. None justify abandoning the goal.

## How to Make It Work

The government can deliver if it acts with clarity and courage.

**1. Secure funding.** Redirect medical aid tax credits. Introduce a modest wealth tax on the top one percent. Use progressive payroll contributions. Radical transparency builds trust.

**2. Rebuild the workforce.** Hire unemployed doctors, nurses and community health workers. End casualisation. Training without employment is sabotage.

**3. Repair infrastructure.** Prioritise water, electricity and basic equipment. Use public works to upgrade clinics and create jobs — direct stimulus.

**4. Protect data commons.** Build open‑source, locally controlled systems. Make every transaction traceable. Public technology enables accountability.

**5. Empower communities.** Health committees, unions and patient associations monitor clinics and report failures. Decentralised oversight is anti‑corruption infrastructure.

**6. Shift narrative.** Stop apologising for redistribution. The Constitution already guarantees healthcare; the NHI operationalises that right.

## The Pace Problem

Implementation drags on. Regulations are expected in 2025. The NHI Fund may only become operational in 2026. Full coverage could take a decade.

Delay reflects political hesitation, not technical inevitability. Elites are rescued overnight; the poor receive "phased approaches". Treat health with the urgency afforded to debt service. Lives are lost while committees deliberate.

Speed must not breed secrecy. Rollout should be public, accountable, participatory. Tangible improvements — shorter queues, working equipment, humane service — grow trust faster than marketing.

---

## What the NHI Means for the People

For millions this reform is life or death. A miner’s widow accesses chemotherapy without selling her home; a rural child receives the same care as a banker’s son; nurses are respected as public servants, not treated as cheap labour.

The NHI embodies collective care. In a society fractured by inequality it can rebuild solidarity: when everyone contributes and everyone benefits, trust returns.

That future will not arrive by decree; it must be fought for. Civil society defends against sabotage and dilution. Unions demand jobs and fair pay. Activists expose corruption before rot sets in.

A just health system will be built from below.

---

## Health, Ecology, and Liberation

Eco‑socialism teaches human and planetary health are the same fight. The logic that poisons rivers also underfunds hospitals and discards workers. A society valuing profit over life destroys both people and planet.

The NHI challenges that logic: life is not a budget line; care is a public good; solidarity is structure, not sentiment.

If the NHI works it proves a post‑colonial society can build universal care without neoliberal fatalism. Democracy becomes more than voting — collective organisation of life.

---

## Closing Reflection

Treating healing as privilege surrenders a nation’s soul. The NHI is a debt owed to the people, not a discretionary gift.

Health is a right — for cities and rural clinics, insured and excluded alike. Making it real demands courage, honesty and relentless pressure.

The task is vast; the principle simple: **a society that refuses to care for its people is already sick.**

— _In solidarity with all who fight for universal, decolonised healthcare._
