# Health Is Not a Privilege: Why South Africa Needs the NHI

South Africans queue for hours in understaffed clinics. Nurses work double shifts with broken tools.
This is not mismanagement alone — it's structural violence: profit before care.

The National Health Insurance (NHI) seeks to end that divide by uniting public and private funding into a single system based on need, not income.

## Why It Matters

Apartheid's geography lives on through healthcare.
Private hospitals consume nearly half of health spending while serving a fraction of the population.
The NHI would pool resources and guarantee universal access — the first real attempt to materialise constitutional promises of dignity.

## The Opposition

Private corporations and their allies warn of collapse and inefficiency.
In truth, they fear equity.
Their model depends on inequality disguised as "choice."
Resistance from business and hesitant technocrats reveals not technical concern but defence of privilege.

## Making It Work

1. **Fund it fairly:** Redirect tax breaks, impose modest wealth and payroll taxes, close corporate loopholes.
2. **Rebuild capacity:** Employ health workers, upgrade infrastructure, localise procurement.
3. **Transparency:** Open-source systems and community oversight.
4. **Speed with accountability:** Lives cannot wait for committees. Implementation must be urgent and public.

## A Broader Vision of Health

Health is not only hospitals. It is clean water, decent work and a livable planet.
The same system that cuts health budgets also pollutes rivers and underpays nurses.
NHI challenges that logic: life before profit.

If it succeeds, South Africa proves that universal care is not utopia — it's democracy in practice.

— In solidarity with all fighting for a health system that serves people, not profit.
