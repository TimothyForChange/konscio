# Health Is Not a Privilege: Why South Africa Needs the NHI

South Africans queue for hours in understaffed clinics. Nurses work double shifts with broken tools. Ambulances take hours to arrive. This is not mismanagement alone — it is structural violence: a health system built on inequality, where quality care is a commodity for those who can pay, and survival is rationed for everyone else.

The National Health Insurance (NHI) is South Africa's first real attempt to end this divide. It seeks to pool public and private funding into a single, universal system based on need, not income. For the first time since apartheid, the country has a chance to build a health system governed by equity rather than profit.

The stakes are simple: either healthcare becomes a guaranteed right, or it remains a privilege purchased through income, geography, and race.

## Why It Matters

Apartheid left behind a geography of inequality that still determines who lives and who dies. Private hospitals consume nearly half of total health spending while serving a small minority. Most people must rely on overstretched public facilities, where staff shortages, failing infrastructure, and chronic underfunding produce exhaustion and avoidable suffering.

The NHI would create a unified fund that equalises resources, redirects public money toward public need, and provides care according to principle rather than purchasing power. It is a confrontation with the country's deepest inequality — the divide between those who can buy care and those who are simply told to wait.

Universal health coverage is not generosity. It is the material expression of dignity.

## The Opposition

Private hospital groups, medical schemes, and corporate lobbies insist the NHI will collapse the health system. They warn of inefficiency, corruption, and “loss of choice.” In reality, they fear equity and the end of a business model built on inequality.

Their profits depend on the fragmentation of care. Their power depends on controlling who receives what treatment at what price. The NHI challenges that logic directly by shifting control to a single public fund accountable to the population, not to shareholders.

Much of the opposition from technocratic circles hides a political truth: a fair system threatens the privileges of those who benefit from the current one.

## What It Will Take to Make the NHI Work

A universal system requires more than legislation. It requires political will, public investment, and democratic oversight. Key steps include:

### Fair and progressive funding

Redirect existing tax breaks for medical schemes. Introduce modest wealth and payroll taxes. Close corporate loopholes. Fund health through public wealth, not regressive cuts.

### Rebuilding state capacity

Hire and train more healthcare workers. Upgrade hospitals and clinics. Localise procurement to reduce waste and corruption. Strengthen community health teams and primary care.

### Transparency and public control

Open-source digital systems. Publish budgets, contracts, and wait-time data. Give communities and workers a real role in oversight.

### Speed with accountability

Lives cannot wait for endless committees. Implementation must be phased but urgent — with clear timelines, public reporting, and direct accountability for failure.

The NHI must avoid the trap of top-down bureaucracy. It must be built through democratic participation, with workers and patients shaping the system.

## Health Beyond Hospitals

Health is shaped by food, water, housing, work, energy, and a livable climate. The same system that underfunds clinics also pollutes rivers, raises electricity prices, expands debt, and underpays essential workers. The NHI cannot fix these alone, but it is part of a broader shift — from commodified survival to public provision of life.

A universal health system strengthens other struggles: for clean water, safe housing, public transport, and ecological justice. When people are healthy and secure, democracy deepens.

---

## The Broader Vision

The NHI is not just a policy change. It is a moral test of the country's direction.

Will South Africa maintain a two-tier system designed by apartheid and perfected by neoliberalism?
Or will it build a single, universal system grounded in equality?

A just health system does not protect privilege. It protects life.

---

## A Right, Not a Commodity

Healthcare should never depend on income, employer, or purchasing power. The NHI moves South Africa closer to a system where the sick are treated because they are human, not because they are profitable.

If the NHI succeeds, South Africa will show that universal care is not utopia — it is democracy made real.
If it fails, inequality will deepen and millions will continue to suffer preventable harm.

The choice is not technical. It is political.

To stand for the NHI is to stand for a society where health is a right — not a privilege reserved for those who can pay.
