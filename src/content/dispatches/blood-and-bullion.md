# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan's War

> "Imperialism leaves behind germs of rot which we must clinically detect and remove from our land and from our minds."

Gold is not neutral. It is capital made visible: heavy, portable and fungible.

In Sudan bullion is the fuel of warfare. It buys drones, lubricates smuggling networks and sustains a parasitic war economy in which militias and foreign brokers profit while regions are emptied of life.

The reality transcends scarcity and chaos. It is structural: **extractivism as war finance**, extractivism as empire.
The same commercial appetites that turned the Congo into mineral violence and Palestine into a laboratory for militarised dispossession now make Sudan's goldfields a prize worth killing for.

## The Currency of Conflict

Sudan's civil war has a material heartbeat: gold.
Since large-scale fighting erupted in April **2023**, the **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)** — a militia born from Janjaweed death squads — have built an economy on smuggling, forced labour and cross-border trade.[^1]

The **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)**, the formal army, represents the institutional legacy of an extractive neo‑colonial state apparatus.

Though formally structured, SAF leadership has long been enmeshed in networks of extraction and corruption that enabled RSF emergence. Even its 'defensive' operations often protect extraction infrastructure and imperial interests rather than civilians.

The SAF's failures are political; the RSF's crimes existential — both emerge from a colonial‑modern state structure built to facilitate extraction.

Investigations show RSF commanders capturing gold mines in Darfur and South Kordofan, forcing miners to work under militia supervision and using profits to import drones and weapons. Towns razed; survivors speak of massacres, rape and forced displacement — violence funded by bullion and lubricated by Gulf money.

Legal exports, official channels and a vast shadow economy channel Sudanese gold to international markets. The **United Arab Emirates** absorbs up to **90%** of declared shipments.[^2] Behind those numbers lies a darker current: **RSF-controlled smuggling networks** moving gold via Chad, Libya and Egypt, bypassing oversight.[^3]

These routes convert looted land into currency, sustaining militias that wage war not for liberation but for control of resource flows under a fragmented imperial apparatus.

## Plunder as Policy

The RSF's economic model is textbook neo‑colonial extraction.
It does not build or govern; it consumes. Its commanders sell gold through foreign intermediaries, buy weapons through the same channels, and use violence to secure new sources of loot.

Darfur, long the site of genocide, has become the militia's treasury. Satellite imagery and reports confirm scorched villages and mass graves. Women enslaved in mining zones; children conscripted. Atrocities are not incidental — they are operating logic.

By contrast SAF power is bureaucratic and brittle: clinging to state legitimacy while lacking social legitimacy. For many civilians it remains the only structure preventing total collapse into warlord rule. SAF is not solution; RSF is abyss.

## Bodies and Land: The Human and Ecological Toll

Human toll is staggering. As of late 2025, conflict deaths exceed **20,000**; **over 12 million people displaced** — the world's largest displacement crisis. Cities — El Geneina, Nyala, Omdurman — scarred by RSF shelling and scorched‑earth tactics. Corridors blocked, aid looted, civilians targeted for ethnicity.

Mining is a second front. Unregulated pits use mercury and cyanide, contaminating rivers and soil. Deforestation spreads across Darfur and South Kordofan. What gold cannot kill by bullet it poisons by run-off.

SAF presence slows some environmental devastation, yet both sides remain trapped in a model where gold underwrites war and ruins recovery. Sudan bleeds for a metal leaving ash.

## A Global Network of Complicity

The international system is not a bystander.
The **UAE's gold markets** and refiners are central to laundering RSF gold, even as the Gulf presents itself as peace broker. Dubai's **Al Etihad Gold** and others process Sudanese gold with minimal oversight.[^4] **Wagner Group** (rebranded after Prigozhin) has trained RSF units and facilitated logistics for mining access; Wagner-linked entities provide advisors, tactical expertise and combat support.

Meanwhile **Egypt** aligns with the SAF, providing political support and opening borders to SAF‑aligned forces and refugees — driven by spillover fears and Nile water politics.

Regional geopolitics are complicated by **Saudi Arabia**, **Qatar** and **Ethiopia**, each drawn in through support, border clashes or mediation. Sudan's gold wealth acts as magnet for regional imperial influence.

Beyond direct support, financial infrastructure enables trade: **Swiss and British banks** clear payments with minimal diligence; **London metals markets** set prices and provide liquidity; **Lloyd's insurers** cover shipments labelled "artisanal"; **Dubai and Istanbul trade finance firms** issue letters of credit disguising origin.

Meanwhile Western governments issue statements on "stability" while their banks process flows that keep trade alive. Sanctions selective; outrage choreographed — a theatre of hypocrisy.

## Empire's Common Thread: Sudan, Congo, Palestine

From Darfur to Donbas, Gaza to Goma, the logic repeats: **resource control through militarised extraction.**
In the DRC cobalt and coltan finance corporate empires.
In Palestine land is expropriated under "security".
In Sudan gold fuels a militia serving as warlord and subcontractor of empire.

**Regional solidarity is emerging.** Chad civil society documents cross‑border RSF movements. **South African trade unions** call for sanctions on Dubai gold markets. **Egyptian rights groups** expose military cooperation. **Kenyan committees** investigate arms flows.

This represents capitalism's natural form in the periphery: organised dispossession.
The imperial core that buys "conflict‑free" gold sells the weapons that make it bloody.

## Disrupting the Gold-Fueled War Machine

This conflict requires structural dismantling rather than pacification by press release.

- **Cut off RSF's gold economy** via supply‑chain enforcement and sanctions on refineries, shippers and Gulf financiers.
- **Hold traders and banks accountable** for laundering via Dubai, Istanbul and European hubs.
- **Support civilian/local governance** over resource zones — community not militia control.
- **Cancel odious debts** and redirect funds to ecological restoration and survivor reparations.
- **Restructure gold markets** so transparency replaces opacity; justice replaces liquidity.

Without these shifts, every gram of gold will carry the weight of a grave.

## The Weight of Gold

Gold is mirror of global greed, not just Sudan's tragedy.
Each ingot refined in Dubai or Zurich carries memory of poisoned rivers and massacred villages.

If serious about decolonisation we must name the system plainly: **RSF plunder is empire profit.**
To end one we must confront both.

— In solidarity with the people of Sudan; with miners, farmers and all who resist extraction.
