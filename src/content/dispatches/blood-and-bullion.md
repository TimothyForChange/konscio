# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan's War

> "Imperialism leaves behind germs of rot which we must clinically detect and remove from our land and from our minds."

Gold is not neutral. It is capital made visible: heavy, portable and fungible.

In Sudan bullion is the fuel of warfare. It buys drones, lubricates smuggling networks and sustains a parasitic war economy in which militias and foreign brokers profit while regions are emptied of life.

The reality transcends scarcity and chaos. It is structural: **extractivism as war finance**, extractivism as empire. The same commercial appetites that turned the Congo into mineral violence now make Sudan's goldfields a prize worth killing for.

## The Currency of Conflict

Sudan's civil war has a material heartbeat: gold.

Since large-scale fighting erupted in April **2023**, the **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)** — a militia evolved from Janjaweed groups — have built an economy on smuggling, forced labour and cross-border trade.

The **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)** represent institutional continuities of an extractive state. Between them, the war economy thrives: RSF controls and taxes mines while SAF defends corridors of formalised extraction.

Investigations show RSF commanders capturing mines in Darfur and South Kordofan, forcing miners to work and taxing outputs. Towns are razed; civilians report massacres, rape and displacement. Gold is turned into cash to buy weaponry, hire brokers, and maintain patronage networks.

## Plunder as Policy

Plunder has been normalised into policy. The RSF's economic model mirrors neo-colonial extraction: sell raw commodity, outsource refining, launder proceeds, and buy weapons. The same financial and logistical circuits that move "ethical" gold from other regions also move Sudanese bullion.

The **UAE** and its trading hubs are central nodes. Declared exports and shadow flows mingle, with a large share of reported shipments moving through Gulf channels. Industrial refineries and middlemen obscure origin; labels and paperwork sanitise the crime.

## Bodies and Land: The Human and Ecological Toll

The human cost is vast. Conflict deaths number in the tens of thousands; millions displaced. Cities and rural economies are devastated. Mining zones see forced labour, child miners, and widespread abuse.

Environmental damage compounds suffering. Artisanal mining uses mercury and cyanide, contaminating rivers and soils. Deforestation expands as pits and roadworks spread. Post-conflict recovery will face poisoned lands and sickened communities.

Gold is both cause and consequence: extraction funds the war that destroys the conditions for peaceful, sustainable livelihoods.

## A Global Network of Complicity

The international system is not merely indifferent — it is complicit.

Refineries, trading houses and financial institutions in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere facilitate flows. Banks clear payments; insurers underwrite shipments; traders provide cover. Statements of concern from governments mean little when markets and logistics remain open.

Wagner-linked actors and other private military networks have at times facilitated access to mines. Regional states offer transit routes. Global demand for gold ensures a market for plundered produce.

Democratic socialists insist solidarity must be material: target the channels that transform stolen resources into currency.

## Disrupting the Gold-Fueled War Machine

To stop the blood-bullion cycle we must attack its logistics:

- **Sanction refineries, traders and intermediaries** that process illicit gold.
- **Impose transparency laws** requiring traceability of origin for all refined gold.
- **Target shipping firms, insurers and banks** complicit in laundering.
- **Support community governance** of resource zones with international guarantees protecting civilians.
- **Cancel burdensome debts** and fund reconstruction through public, accountable mechanisms.

These measures require coordinated pressure from states, unions, civil society and transnational movements. Action at ports, financial centres and trade hubs can choke the supply lines that keep militias funded.

## Toward Justice and Reconstruction

Ending the war economy is only the first step. Post-conflict Sudan will need democratic control over resources, reparations for survivors, environmental remediation and public investment in health, education and livelihoods.

Gold should be an asset for reconstruction — not a currency of war. That requires international oversight that respects local democratic choices, and the removal of predatory actors that profit from violence.

## The Weight of Gold

Each ingot refined in distant docks carries the cost of burned villages and poisoned rivers. The market price is measured in lives.

If we are serious about decolonisation and justice, we must link local struggles to global levers. Strip the markets that fund violence; hold intermediaries accountable; and build economic alternatives that put people before profit.

— In solidarity with Sudan's displaced, miners, farmers and all resisting plunder.
