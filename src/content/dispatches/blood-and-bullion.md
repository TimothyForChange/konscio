# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan's War

> "Imperialism leaves behind germs of rot which we must clinically detect and remove from our land and from our minds."

Gold is not neutral. It is capital made visible — heavy, portable, and fungible.

In Sudan, bullion is the fuel of war. It buys drones, finances militias, and sustains a war economy in which elites and foreign brokers profit while communities are destroyed.

The pattern is not chaos. It is structure — extraction as warfare, extraction as empire. The same appetites that consumed the Congo now burn through Sudan's goldfields.

## The Currency of Conflict

Since fighting erupted in April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) — born from the Janjaweed militias — have built a parallel economy of smuggling and forced labour.

The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), heirs to an extractive state, guard formal concessions. Between them, gold becomes both prize and payment.
RSF commanders seize mines in Darfur and South Kordofan; miners work under threat; proceeds fund weapons and loyalty.

Towns are razed, civilians massacred, and millions displaced — all in service of a resource economy turned inside out.

## Plunder as Policy

Plunder has become governance. The RSF's model mirrors global extraction: sell raw commodity, outsource refining, launder proceeds, import arms.

The UAE's trading hubs sit at the centre of these flows. Official exports and shadow shipments merge; paperwork sanitises theft. "Ethical gold" and blood gold share the same refineries.

## Bodies and Land: The Human and Ecological Toll

The cost is counted in bodies and poisoned earth.
Tens of thousands dead; millions displaced. Mercury and cyanide from mining seep into rivers; deforestation spreads as pits expand.

War ruins not only lives but landscapes — the ecology collapsing with the society that depends on it.
Recovery will demand environmental healing as much as political reconciliation.

---

## A Global Network of Complicity

Markets and militaries are entwined.
Refineries, traders, and financiers in the Middle East and Europe handle the gold that funds Sudan's destruction.
Banks process payments; insurers cover shipments; states issue statements while trade continues.

Private military networks, including remnants of Wagner-linked actors, have facilitated access to mines.
The global economy quietly digests plunder.

## Disrupting the War Economy

To end the blood-bullion cycle, action must target its logistics and legitimacy:

- **Sanction refineries and traders** handling untraceable gold.
- **Enforce transparency laws** requiring verified origin for refined bullion.
- **Hold shipping, insurance, and banking actors accountable** for laundering.
- **Support community governance** of mining regions with international protection for civilians.
- **Cancel illegitimate debt** and fund reconstruction through public, accountable mechanisms.

These steps strike where war profits most — its supply chains.

## Toward Justice and Reconstruction

Ending the war economy is only the beginning.
Post-war Sudan will need democratic control over resources, reparations for survivors, and ecological restoration.

Gold must become an asset for renewal, not a currency of death.
Reconstruction should heal both people and land — the social and environmental wounds together.

## The Weight of Gold

Each bar refined in distant ports carries the weight of burned villages and silent rivers.
Its price is measured in lives, not dollars.

If justice means anything, it must connect the human and the ecological, the local and the global — dismantling the system that turns the Earth's wealth into instruments of war.

— In solidarity with Sudan's displaced, miners, farmers, and all resisting plunder.
