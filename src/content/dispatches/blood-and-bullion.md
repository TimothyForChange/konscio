# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan's War

Gold is not neutral. It is wealth made portable — a currency of power, conflict, and escape. In Sudan, gold funds the machinery of war. It pays for weapons, buys loyalties, and sustains the fragmentation of a state trapped between rival armed elites.

Since fighting erupted in April 2023, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have used gold not only as revenue but as strategy. Extraction is not a by-product of conflict — it is the logic driving it.

Sudan's war is not chaos. It is organised plunder.

## The Currency of Conflict

The RSF, born from the Janjaweed militias responsible for atrocities in Darfur, now controls major gold sites through force. Civilians dig ore under armed supervision. Smuggling routes move bullion across borders into Chad, the UAE, and beyond.
The SAF, heirs to Sudan's extractive state, rely on formal concessions and alliances with local elites.

Gold becomes both the prize and the fuel:

- RSF seizes artisanal and industrial mines.
- SAF protects large concessions tied to military-linked companies.
- Both sides trade gold for weapons, drones, and political backing.

The result is a war economy where communities are destroyed so that commanders can enrich themselves.

## Plunder as Governance

In the absence of a functioning state, armed groups create their own economic systems.
The RSF's model mirrors global extraction:

- seize mine
- force labour
- smuggle ore
- launder profits through foreign hubs
- import weapons and logistics

The UAE's trading networks sit at the centre of this cycle. “Ethical gold” and blood gold pass through the same refineries — distinctions erased by paperwork.

## Human and Ecological Devastation

The human toll is immense:

- Tens of thousands killed, millions displaced.
- Entire towns emptied or burned.
- Sexual violence used as a tool of terror.

The ecological damage is also profound:

- Mercury and cyanide seep into rivers.
- Forests and farmland are cleared for pits.
- Livestock and water systems collapse under toxic runoff.

War destroys society and environment together. Recovery will require ecological restoration as much as political reconciliation.

## Regional and Global Complicity

Sudan's gold flows through a network of actors:

- **Refineries in Dubai and Istanbul** that process gold of unknown origin.
- **Private military companies and brokers** linked to global mercenary networks.
- **Banks and insurers** that facilitate trade.
- **Regional regimes** benefiting from cheap smuggled gold and geopolitical leverage.

International sanctions target some individuals but leave the underlying system untouched. The global economy quietly digests plunder.

## Breaking the War Economy

Ending Sudan's war requires cutting off the financial arteries that sustain it. Key steps include:

- **Sanctioning refineries and traders** dealing in unverifiable gold.
- **Mandatory origin verification** for imported bullion.
- **Criminal liability** for banks, insurers, and logistics firms that launder conflict gold.
- **Protection for civilians** in mining zones through international monitors.
- **Debt cancellation and public reconstruction** to prevent post-war looting by creditors.

Peace demands more than diplomacy — it demands dismantling the economic infrastructure of war.

---

## A Path Toward Justice

When the fighting ends, Sudan will need:

- democratic control over mining,
- public oversight of resource revenues,
- ecological restoration of poisoned landscapes,
- and reparations for communities displaced or harmed.

Gold must shift from currency of death to asset for reconstruction.
Only democratic ownership can break the cycle of extraction, militarisation, and collapse.

## The Weight of Gold

Every refined bar carries the weight of burned villages, poisoned rivers, and shattered families. Its true price is measured in lives.

Justice requires exposing the system that turns Sudan's land into a war chest — and building a future where resources sustain life, not annihilation.
