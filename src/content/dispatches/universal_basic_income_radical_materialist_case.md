# Universal Basic Income: A Radical, Materialist Case

Universal Basic Income (UBI) promises security and simplicity — income without stigma or bureaucracy.
But simplicity hides struggle.
UBI can either challenge inequality or stabilise it. The difference lies in power.

## Between Emancipation and Containment

A UBI funded by capital becomes subsidy for exploitation; one rooted in public wealth redistributes ownership.
The goal is not cash alone but freedom — from coercion, debt and deprivation.

Without structural reform, payments vanish into rent and prices.
Anchored in public provision, they expand collective capacity and time for care, creativity and organising.

---

## Conditions for Liberation

A social UBI must rest on:

- **Universality and adequacy** — no means tests, no tokenism.
- **Public systems** — health, housing, education and transport shield income from capture.
- **Democratic finance** — taxes on wealth, extraction and pollution; cancellation of illegitimate debt.
- **Ecological planning** — income supporting sustainable production, not consumption without limits.
- **Global coordination** — tax cooperation and reparative transfers to prevent capital flight.

These make income a floor for transformation, not a cushion for decline.

## Beyond Technocratic Fixes

Cash without power changes nothing.
The ruling class fears a UBI tied to labour rights, public ownership and ecological transition because it threatens dependency on capital.

The task is to win it through struggle, not consultancy.
Movements for living wages, debt justice and care work all converge here: economic security as collective right, not market mercy.

---

## The Purpose of Freedom

UBI's promise is not leisure for the few but liberation for the many.
It can turn survival into life — if embedded in democracy, ecology and solidarity.

Otherwise it will be another reform absorbed by the system it claims to soften.

— For a UBI that builds power, not pacification.
