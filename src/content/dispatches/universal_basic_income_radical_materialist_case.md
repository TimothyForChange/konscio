# Universal Basic Income: A Radical, Materialist Case

Universal Basic Income (UBI) has returned to global debate because insecurity is now the common condition of life. Wages stagnate while profits soar. Debt replaces wages. Gig work expands. Austerity hollows out public services. Crises — pandemic, inflation, climate shocks — hit the working majority while capital grows richer.

UBI is often presented as a simple fix: give everyone cash, no questions asked. But simplicity hides struggle. A UBI can shift power toward people or entrench the power of capital. The difference lies in the system around it — who funds it, who captures it, and who it ultimately serves.

UBI is not a neutral policy. It is a political battlefield.

## What UBI Is — and What It Isn't

A Universal Basic Income has four defining features:

- **Universal:** everyone receives it.
- **Unconditional:** no means tests or work requirements.
- **Individual:** paid to each person, not households.
- **Regular and cash-based:** predictable income, not restricted vouchers.

It is not a jobs guarantee, not a poverty grant, not a negative income tax, and not a substitute for public services. These distinctions matter because many proposals use the UBI label while smuggling in conditions, cuts, or surveillance.

## Between Emancipation and Containment

A UBI can liberate — or pacify.

A **capital-funded UBI** tied to austerity becomes a subsidy for exploitation. Landlords raise rents, corporations raise prices, and governments cut public services under the banner of “efficiency.” Cash becomes a replacement for rights rather than an expansion of them.

A **social UBI**, rooted in public wealth and protected by strong public institutions, shifts power toward people. It reduces precarity, strengthens labour bargaining, and gives communities time to organise.

Examples illustrate the divergence:

- Finland's pilot improved well-being but remained too small to alter structural power.
- Brazil's Bolsa Familia, though not a UBI, showed how income security strengthens social systems when paired with public provision.
- Alaska's dividend demonstrates universality but lacks transformative potential in an extractive, market-dominated model.
- Namibia's pilot showed immediate gains in nutrition and schooling but failed to scale without political backing.

The meaning of UBI depends entirely on the political economy around it.

## How Capital Can Capture UBI

Without structural protection, UBI becomes revenue for capital. Capture happens through:

### Rent extraction

Landlords raise rents because tenants have more cash. Housing shortages transform income into profit.

### Price pass-through

Corporations raise prices in concentrated sectors such as food, transport, and electricity.

### Austerity repackaged

Governments cut public services by arguing that UBI “simplifies” welfare. Risk shifts from the state to individuals.

### Surveillance and fees

Fintech companies try to dominate payment systems, extracting fees and data.

### Wage suppression

Employers treat UBI as a wage subsidy unless labour law and collective bargaining are strengthened.

Cash alone cannot defeat concentrated market power.

## Conditions for Liberation

For UBI to expand freedom, five conditions anchor it:

### Universality and adequacy

Amounts must track living costs and inflation. Anything less becomes symbolic.

### Public systems

Housing, healthcare, education, energy, and transport must be publicly funded and affordable. These systems prevent corporate capture of income.

### Democratic finance

Funding must come from wealth taxes, capital gains, land value capture, mineral royalties, and cancellation of illegitimate debt — not regressive consumption taxes.

### Ecological planning

Income security must fit within ecological limits. Public provisioning of energy, food, and mobility prevents a spike in carbon-intensive consumption.

### Global coordination

Tax cooperation, capital controls, and reparative transfers prevent capital flight and a race to the bottom.

These conditions make UBI a foundation for transformation rather than a substitute for social rights.

---

## UBI, Labour, and Power

The central question is how UBI affects class power.

### Strengthening workers

With guaranteed income, workers can refuse abusive work, strike longer, and demand better conditions.

### Capital's counter-moves

Employers may suppress wages or deepen precarity. A strong UBI requires strong labour law and collective bargaining to prevent wage substitution.

### Time as power

Freed time for care, study, rest, and organising expands democratic capacity. This is UBI's most radical potential.

UBI is not a replacement for labour struggle; it is a tool that shifts the balance within it.

## UBI in the Global South

Most UBI writing assumes Northern conditions. In the South:

- Informality dominates.
- Agriculture and subsistence economies matter.
- Debt traps restrict fiscal space.
- Extractive industries drain public revenue.

A Global South UBI must be paired with resource sovereignty, capital controls, debt justice, and public industrial policy. Without these, cash flows upward and outward through extraction and imported commodities.

---

## UBI and Ecological Limits

A UBI detached from ecological planning risks increasing material throughput. But a UBI embedded within ecological limits can strengthen the transition:

- It stabilises communities facing climate shocks.
- It supports low-carbon livelihoods.
- It protects workers during fossil fuel phaseouts.
- It reduces dependence on destructive industries.
- It broadens the political base for ecological planning by reducing fear and precarity.

Income security is not an add-on to climate policy. It is a condition for its success.

## Beyond Technocratic Fixes

Technocratic UBI proposals promise stability through administrative simplicity. But stability without power is pacification. UBI becomes transformative only when tied to labour rights, public ownership, ecological ceilings, democratic control, and organised movements capable of defending gains.

Winning UBI requires struggle, not consultancy.

---

## The Purpose of Freedom

UBI's promise is not a small stipend or a market stimulus. It is the chance to replace fear with autonomy, coercion with choice, and exhaustion with dignity.

A UBI embedded in democracy, ecology, and public systems expands freedom for the many. A UBI captured by capital stabilises inequality for the few.

The real question is not whether UBI is desirable, but **who will shape it — and in whose interest.**

A liberatory UBI is one built through collective power and used to build more of it: the floor beneath broader social transformation, not the ceiling of possibility.
