# Universal Basic Income: A Radical, Materialist Case

> "For a colonised people the most essential value, because it is the most concrete, is first and foremost the land: the land which will bring them bread and, above all, dignity."

## What UBI Is — and What It Isn't

Universal Basic Income (UBI) is simple: everyone receives a regular, unconditional public payment. No means test. No work requirement. No humiliation. Its aim is to guarantee dignity and freedom from destitution.

Simplicity hides struggle. UBI can emancipate — or become a technocratic patch on exploitation. Funded and controlled by capital it subsidises low wages and privatised survival; grounded in public power it redistributes wealth, time and ownership.

This essay argues for the second path: a **UBI anchored in social planning, public provision and decolonial finance** — a basic income that weakens extraction instead of stabilising it.

UBI alone cannot cure poverty. Without structural change it is absorbed by profit, rent and debt. Embedded in democratic public services, debt justice and ecological planning, it can help shift power from capital to people.

## Why This Debate Matters

Poverty is designed — through austerity, debt adjustment and trade liberalisation stripping wealth from labour and land. Wages suppressed, commons enclosed, public services gutted.

UBI crystallises a choice: **manage capitalism's wreckage or transform its structure.**
Either we continue cushioning exploitation with market-friendly welfare, or we build a system where social policy redistributes power, not just income.

Properly designed, UBI can increase workers' bargaining power, freeing people from coerced labour and creating time for care, organising and political life. But if extraction and privatisation remain intact, the money will be devoured by landlords, creditors and corporate monopolies.

The question, then, is not whether to support UBI — but **which UBI**, and as part of **what wider transformation**.

## What the Evidence Shows

Pilot evidence is useful yet limited. Cash transfers reduce poverty, improve health, increase resilience. Trials in Kenya, Finland and Stockton show gains in food security and mental well-being. The "lazy worker" myth collapses.

Employment effects depend on context. Where strong labour protections and public services exist, UBI increases bargaining power without mass job loss. Where services are privatised and jobs precarious, it becomes a tool for survival, not liberation.

Inflation debates reveal class politics: modest transfers rarely trigger inflation; fear often masks elite anxiety over rising worker leverage.

The lesson is clear: **cash helps, but structure decides.** Small, token payments stabilise exploitation; universal, adequate income tied to public services shifts power. This fundamental principle underlies all meaningful social transformation.

## The Trap of a Market-Friendly UBI

Detached from structural reform, UBI repeats three failures.

**First** commodification: cash replacing services makes survival a private transaction; health, housing and education sold back at inflated prices.

**Second** cheap labour normalisation: minimal income floor justifies suppressed wages and dismantled protections; without union power or public jobs precarity deepens.

**Third** ecological breakdown: disposable income rise without production shift accelerates extraction. A "green transition" built on resource plunder plus regressive financing turns UBI into imperial management.

**Market-friendly UBI offers individual security inside a system built on collective insecurity.**
Capital needs unemployment, debt and cheap resources; UBI leaving these intact merely oils the machine.

Neoliberal stabilisation: manage unrest with cash, privatise commons, protect profit. Beneficiaries: finance, tech monopolies, extractive firms, employers seeking wage subsidies. On the other side: workers, small farmers, Indigenous communities, women in unpaid care — labour and land sustaining capital.

## What a Social UBI Would Look Like

To liberate, UBI must embed in **a wider social programme** that democratises ownership, decarbonises production and restores commons.

### Democratic Foundations

Control must rest with people not markets: resource rents, services and distribution governed by democratic institutions — councils, unions, cooperatives — not private contractors or foreign lenders.

### Universality and Adequacy

Means-testing breeds stigma and bureaucracy. Universality affirms shared rights. Payments must cover essentials; token grants entrench precarity.

### Public Provision

Cash must sit alongside universal healthcare, housing, childcare, education and transport. Public systems block rentier capture; without them cash dissolves into inflation and profiteering.

### Financing Justice

Fund through **progressive taxation and reparative finance** — wealth taxes, transaction levies, windfall taxes on extractive profits, pollution levies. Cancel odious debts locking the Global South into extraction. Cancellation is restitution, not charity.

### Reclaiming Resource Rents

Extractive profits must flow into social wages and ecological restoration. In South Africa mineral rent taxation could fund UBI and public decarbonisation employment.

### Work and Dignity

Pair UBI with jobs guarantee in care, restoration and climate work — expanding labour freedom. Work should be dignified, socially useful, ecologically sane — not coerced survival.

### Ecological Transformation

Social UBI must shrink footprints by reorganising production: public transport over private cars; shared infrastructure over wasteful individualism. High living standards via collective provision, not endless growth.

### Global Solidarity

Capital flight and tax evasion are transnational; justice must be too. Progressive tax coordination, corporate accountability and reparative transfers essential — otherwise UBI bleeds offshore.

Precedents exist: **Brazil's Bolsa Família** combines cash transfers with healthcare and education; **South Africa's social grants** show redistribution viability amid constraint; **Kerala's localised planning** integrates social provision, ecology and participatory budgeting. Task: **weave fragments into coherent social plan.**

---

## Answering the Predictable Objections

**"It will make people lazy."**
Evidence contradicts. People use cash to meet needs, not avoid work. UBI undermines compulsion to accept exploitation.

**"It's unaffordable."**
Affordability is political. States fund militaries, bank bailouts, fossil subsidies. Wealth exists; it is hoarded. Redirect it.

**"It will pacify people."**
Depends on design. Minimal, marketised payment can pacify; **adequate, universal, publicly controlled** income enlarges space for organising and resistance — why elites fear it.

---

## From Policy to Power

UBI will be won **through organised struggle** not technocratic persuasion. Policy follows power.

The coalition capable of winning social UBI exists in fragments:

- workers in formal and informal economies whose labour is precarious and devalued;
- women performing unpaid care underpinning accumulation;
- communities resisting extraction, dispossession and pollution;
- Indigenous movements defending land and life;
- young people facing ecological and economic collapse.

These struggles form a common front against a system exploiting labour, colonising nature, disciplining life through debt.

Campaigns for living wage, debt cancellation, public ownership build foundations of social UBI. Each act of resistance strengthens capacity to demand redistribution on our terms, not the market’s.

---

## A Final Demand

UBI can be liberation — if part of a broader fight for democracy, ecology and justice.

Insist on **universal and adequate** income funded by taxing wealth and extraction, not the poor. Pair with public services and jobs guarantee. Anchor in democratic control and global solidarity.

Not charity — restitution: redistribution of what was stolen from workers, communities and the earth.

Fight for UBI as floor of a new social order, not patch for empire's decay.
