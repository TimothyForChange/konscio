excerpt: "The Congo Basin is the Earth's second lung, absorbing billions of tonnes of carbon each year. Yet it is being sacrificed for profit through logging, mining, and false 'green' promises. This is not just an environmental crisis; it is a struggle for democracy, justice, and survival."

# The Congo Basin: Africa's Lungs Under Siege

The Congo Basin is one of Earth's great climate lifelines — a rainforest spanning six countries, storing billions of tonnes of carbon, regulating rainfall across the continent, and sustaining millions of people. It is often called Africa's lung because it helps the planet breathe.

Yet the Basin is being carved up by logging, mining, oil exploration, and “green” projects that replicate colonial patterns of dispossession. The world depends on this forest but allows it to be sacrificed for profit.

This is not just environmental destruction. It is a struggle over sovereignty, democracy, and the right to determine the future of one of the planet's last great ecosystems.

## A New Scramble for the Congo Basin

Governments across the region auction off logging concessions, oil blocks, and “sustainable development zones.”
Foreign firms — from French loggers to Chinese miners to Western agribusiness — compete for control.
Roads and pipelines slice through intact forest corridors.
Palm oil plantations expand under the banner of green growth.

The Basin stores roughly 25% of the world's tropical forest carbon. Destroying it is not a local issue — it is a planetary emergency.

## When Sustainability Becomes Exploitation

Global North governments and conservation groups promote carbon markets, REDD+ schemes, and “offset” projects that allow major polluters to continue emitting while purchasing credits from the Global South.

In practice:

- forests become commodities,
- Indigenous communities are displaced,
- conservation becomes militarised,
- and carbon markets entrench foreign control over African land.

Many carbon concessions overlap Indigenous territories without free, prior, and informed consent.
This is carbon colonialism — extraction dressed in green.

## Whose Forest, Whose Benefit?

For Indigenous peoples — Baka, Batwa, BaAka, Mbendjele, and many others — the forest is home, sustenance, culture, and history. Yet conservation projects often evict communities or criminalise traditional practices under the guise of protecting biodiversity.

Investigations document:

- violent evictions by armed eco-guards,
- intimidation, arrests, and abuse,
- and the expansion of protected areas without community input.

Living with the forest — not being removed from it — is true conservation.

## From Carbon Sink to Carbon Source

Scientists warn that the Basin is weakening. It now absorbs far less carbon than in the 1990s. Continued degradation could flip it from a sink to a source within decades, accelerating climate breakdown.

The consequences would be severe:

- disrupted rainfall from West Africa to Ethiopia,
- intensified droughts and floods,
- collapse of farming and water systems,
- and accelerated warming globally.

Destroying the Basin dismantles one of the Earth's last functioning climate stabilisers.

## The Lie of Green Capitalism

The Global North presents itself as custodian of the planet while outsourcing destruction to the South.
“Forest protection funds” mask the fact that control remains foreign.
Local knowledge is sidelined; corporations and conservation NGOs dominate decision-making.

Green capitalism treats African land as a carbon sponge rather than a political territory inhabited by people with rights.

True climate justice demands democratic control — not technocratic management imposed from abroad.

---

## Indigenous Rights as Climate Strategy

Protecting the Basin means confronting extractive models and empowering those who live inside the forest. A just strategy includes:

- legal recognition of Indigenous and community land rights,
- enforcing corporate accountability with binding laws,
- redirecting revenues to public services and ecological restoration,
- and replacing export dependency with diversified, locally rooted economies.

Land rights are climate policy.
Community governance is conservation.

## A Last Stand for a Living Planet

The Basin shelters thousands of species, hundreds of cultures, and millions of people. It anchors the climate of the continent and the stability of the planet.

Allowing it to be sacrificed is collective suicide.

Protecting the Congo Basin is not charity. It is self-defence — for Africa, and for the world.

The choice is stark: a forest governed by its people, or a forest consumed by global extraction.
