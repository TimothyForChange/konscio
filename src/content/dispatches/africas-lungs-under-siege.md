excerpt: "The Congo Basin is the Earth's second lung, absorbing billions of tonnes of carbon each year. Yet it is being sacrificed for profit through logging, mining, and false 'green' promises. This is not just an environmental crisis; it is a struggle for democracy, justice, and survival."

# The Congo Basin: Africa's Lungs Under Siege

Locals call the Congo Basin the lungs of Africa — it's a rainforest so vast it actually helps the planet breathe.

This massive forest stretches across six nations, covering more than 200 million hectares. Every year, it absorbs roughly 1.2 billion tonnes of CO₂. This helps regulate rainfall across the continent and anchors planetary climate stability.

But these forests are under attack from the same forces that have been plundering the region's minerals for decades: profit, imperial power, and a colonial mindset that sees Africa as nothing more than a warehouse to be exploited.

This isn't just about trees. It's about who decides the fate of the planet's last frontiers — and who bears the cost.

## Africa's New Resource Grab

From Kinshasa to Brazzaville to Yaoundé, governments auction logging concessions, oil blocks, and “sustainable development” zones that carve deep scars into one of Earth's most vital ecosystems.

French logging giants, Chinese mining firms, and Western-backed agribusinesses vie for control. Roads and rail lines slice through once-intact forest corridors. Palm oil plantations expand under the banner of “green growth.” Even the World Bank and IMF promote timber exports as a path to “poverty reduction.”

Truth is, it's a new Scramble for Africa — but now the spoils are measured in hectares of rainforest and tonnes of carbon, not rubber and ivory. The imperial logic that carved the Basin at Berlin now parcels it out through contracts, concessions, and carbon markets.

The Congo Basin holds roughly 25% of the world's tropical forest carbon stock. Cutting it down isn't just a regional loss — it's a planetary emergency.

## When Sustainability Means Exploitation

Western governments and corporations insist that “sustainable forestry” and “offset programmes” will protect the Basin. In practice they entrench exploitation under a green veneer.

Take carbon credit schemes like REDD+. They let polluters in the Global North continue emitting while claiming they're 'offsetting' their pollution by paying for conservation in the South.

In practice climate finance replaces colonial tribute: money flows northward via credits while communities lose access to land they've stewarded for generations. Forests become commodities, not commons; the atmosphere becomes a marketplace, not a shared inheritance.

Investigations show that new 'carbon concessions' in the DRC often overlap Indigenous territories and are negotiated without Free, Prior and Informed Consent. Sometimes they're just rebranded logging concessions. This is carbon colonialism under a green banner.

## Whose Forest, Whose Benefit?

For Indigenous peoples — Baka, Batwa, BaAka and many others — the forest is life: pharmacy, school, temple. Yet in the name of conservation and carbon trading, communities are evicted from ancestral lands.

“Protected areas” and logging concessions alike arrive with militarised enforcement. Armed guards patrol lands once open to hunting and gathering. Those who resist are criminalised as “poachers”; those who protest risk imprisonment or worse.

UN and NGO reports document violent evictions and abuses by eco-guards funded by major international conservation groups, including WWF. These operations mirror the extractive logic they claim to oppose: conservation displacing communities who have stewarded these lands for generations.

Despite violence, resistance endures. Indigenous women's networks in Itombwe and Équateur lead community reforestation projects and protest illegal logging. Youth groups map forest crimes with GPS; associations demand legal recognition of collective land rights. Across the Basin people assert a radical truth: living with the forest is wisdom, not backwardness.

## From Carbon Sink to Carbon Source: An Ecological Crisis

Scientists warn the Basin could soon flip from carbon sink to carbon source if degradation continues. Central African forests absorb roughly half as much CO₂ as in the 1990s, and without protection could emit more than they store within decades.

Consequences are global. Basin forests recycle **75–95%** of their own rainfall and generate up to **17%** of West Africa's rain via evapotranspiration, feeding weather systems as far as the Sahel and Ethiopian Highlands. Loss would destabilise rainfall, intensify droughts and floods, and accelerate planetary heating.

Destroying the Basin dismantles one of Earth's last living climate regulators — a planetary lung collapsing under the weight of capital and neglect.

## The Lie of Green Capitalism

Global North governments congratulate themselves for funding “forest protection” programmes; the fine print tells another story.

Conservation is outsourced to Western NGOs. Profits are privatised while decision-making remains foreign. Local knowledge is ignored; sovereignty denied.

Northern climate politics often repeat this pattern: demanding emission cuts at home while staying silent about corporate pillage in the South. This selective environmentalism treats African land as a carbon sponge rather than territory inhabited by people with political rights.

True climate justice requires more than technological fixes or markets. It demands democratic control of natural wealth — by those who live with it, not those who profit from it.

## Indigenous Rights as Climate Action

To protect the Basin is to challenge the system that endangers it.
That means recognising forest peoples' right to govern land, rejecting extractive “green growth,” and demanding reparative climate finance — not charity, justice.

A genuinely democratic socialist approach would:

- Return control of forests to Indigenous and local communities through recognition of collective land rights and Free, Prior and Informed Consent.
- End export dependency by building locally rooted, diversified economies.
- Hold corporations accountable via binding law, transparent supply chains, and liability for harm.
- Democratise energy and development so wealth funds restoration, not destruction.

Protecting the Basin is planetary self-defence — not altruism, but solidarity.

## Last Stand for the Living Planet

The forest breathes for all life. Its rivers carry the memory of millions of years. Its canopy shelters **10,000+ plant species** (nearly **30% endemic**) and over **400 mammals** and **1,000 bird species**. More than **150 ethnic groups**, including BaAka, BaMbuti and Efe peoples, depend on it for survival.

Yet it is being silenced by chainsaws, pipelines and profit.

If we allow the Basin to die, a part of ourselves dies with it.

> "Wake up, humanity! We are out of time. We must shake our conscience free of the rapacious capitalism, racism, and patriarchy that are destroying the Earth."
> — Berta Cáceres, Indigenous Lenca environmental defender (assassinated 3 March 2016)

The fate of the Basin is not a regional concern; it is a moral and ecological question of our time.
Will humanity continue to consume the planet's lungs — or finally learn to breathe in solidarity?

— In solidarity with the peoples of the Congo Basin and all who defend life on Earth.
