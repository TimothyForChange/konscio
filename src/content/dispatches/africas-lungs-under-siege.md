description: "An eco-socialist analysis of how deforestation, extractivism, and neo-colonial conservation threaten the Congo Basin — and how solidarity and public power can defend one of Earth's vital climate lifelines."
excerpt: "The Congo Basin is the Earth's second lung, absorbing billions of tonnes of carbon each year. Yet it is being sacrificed for profit through logging, mining, and false 'green' promises. This is not just an environmental crisis; it is a struggle for democracy, justice, and survival."

# The Congo Basin: Africa's Lungs Under Siege

Locals call the Congo Basin the lungs of Africa — a rainforest so vast it helps the planet breathe.

Stretching across six nations and more than 200 million hectares, the Basin absorbs roughly 1.2 billion tonnes of CO₂ each year. It regulates rainfall across the continent and anchors global climate stability.

But these forests are under attack from the same forces that have long plundered the region's minerals: profit, imperial ambition, and a colonial mindset that sees Africa as a storehouse for others.

This isn't just about trees. It's about power — who decides the fate of Earth's last frontiers, and who pays the price.

## Africa's New Resource Grab

From Kinshasa to Brazzaville to Yaoundé, governments auction off logging concessions, oil blocks, and "sustainable development zones" that carve deep scars into one of the planet's most vital ecosystems.

French logging firms, Chinese mining giants, and Western agribusinesses compete for control. Roads and rail lines slice through intact forest corridors. Palm oil plantations expand under the banner of "green growth." Even the World Bank and IMF endorse timber exports as "poverty reduction."

It's a new Scramble for Africa — the spoils measured in hectares of rainforest and tonnes of carbon, not rubber and ivory. The imperial logic that divided the Basin at Berlin now parcels it out through contracts, concessions, and carbon markets.

The Congo Basin stores roughly 25% of the world's tropical forest carbon. Cutting it down is not a regional loss — it's a planetary emergency.

## When Sustainability Means Exploitation

Western governments and corporations claim "sustainable forestry" and "offset programmes" protect the Basin. In practice they entrench exploitation under a green veneer.

Schemes like REDD+ let major polluters in the Global North keep emitting while buying credits from the Global South. Money flows north; control flows away from local communities. Forests become commodities, not commons.

Investigations show many "carbon concessions" in the DRC overlap Indigenous territories, often without free and informed consent. Some are rebranded logging zones. This is carbon colonialism, painted green.

> "Carbon-trading policies, in effect, allow rich polluters the right to carry on business as usual, while poorer nations bear the burden of absorbing the consequences."
> — Larry Lohmann, Carbon Trading: A Critical Conversation on Climate Change, Privatisation and Power (2006)

## Whose Forest, Whose Benefit?

For Indigenous peoples — Baka, Batwa, BaAka, and many others — the forest is home, pharmacy, and memory. Yet in the name of conservation and carbon trading, communities are evicted from ancestral lands.

Armed guards patrol "protected areas." Those who resist are branded poachers; those who speak out risk imprisonment or worse. Reports document violent evictions and abuse by eco-guards funded by major conservation groups — operations mirroring the extractive logic they claim to oppose.

Still, resistance endures. Women's cooperatives lead reforestation projects; youth groups map forest crimes with GPS; associations fight for collective land rights. They embody an ecological truth: **living with the forest is sustainability itself.**

## From Carbon Sink to Carbon Source

Scientists warn the Basin could soon flip from carbon sink to carbon source. Central African forests now absorb barely half the CO₂ they did in the 1990s. Continued degradation could turn them into emitters within decades.

These forests recycle up to 95% of their rainfall and feed weather systems reaching the Sahel and the Ethiopian Highlands. Their loss would disrupt rainfall, deepen droughts and floods, and destabilise the continent's climate.

Destroying the Basin dismantles one of Earth's last living regulators — a lung collapsing under the weight of capital and neglect.

## The Lie of Green Capitalism

Global North governments boast of "forest protection" funds. The reality: conservation is outsourced, profits privatised, sovereignty denied. Local knowledge is sidelined; decision-making stays foreign.

This selective environmentalism treats African land as a carbon sponge rather than a political territory inhabited by citizens.

True climate justice demands more than technology or markets. It requires democratic control of natural wealth — by those who live with it, not those who extract it.

---

## Indigenous Rights as Climate Action

Defending the Basin means confronting the system that endangers it. That starts with recognising forest peoples' right to govern their lands and rejecting extractive "green growth."

A just approach would:

- Restore control of forests to Indigenous and local communities through collective land rights.
- Replace export dependency with diversified, locally rooted economies.
- Enforce corporate accountability with binding law and transparency.
- Channel public wealth into restoration and climate resilience.

Empowering forest peoples isn't charity — it's climate strategy.

## Last Stand for the Living Planet

The Congo Basin shelters over 10,000 plant species (nearly a third endemic), 400 mammals, and 1,000 birds. More than 150 ethnic groups depend on it for survival.

Yet it's being silenced by chainsaws, pipelines, and profit.

If the Basin dies, part of humanity dies with it.

> "Wake up, humanity! We are out of time. We must shake our conscience free of the rapacious capitalism, racism, and patriarchy that are destroying the Earth."
> — Berta Cáceres (1971–2016)

Protecting the Basin is not charity. It's self-defence — for the planet we share.

— Standing with forest communities and ecosystems everywhere.
