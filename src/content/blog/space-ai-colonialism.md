# Empire's New Frontiers: From Space Militarisation To AI Colonialism

> "The exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries … and shall be the province of all mankind."
> — Outer Space Treaty (Article I)

Empires remake their instruments when the old ones grow blunt. They do not stop wanting control; they change how they get it.

In the twenty-first century, the new instruments are orbital and algorithmic — satellites, constellations, cloud servers, and machine-learning models.

Together they form an _imperial stack_: layers of hardware and software that let states and corporations see, score, and govern the world from above.

They are precise. They are profitable. They are quiet. They also reproduce the same old hierarchy: a handful of powerful states and firms decide who can be seen, who can speak, who can move, and who must remain invisible.

This is not speculative theory. It is visible in policy, budgets, and the headlines. The United States created a separate Space Force in December 2019 — an explicit admission that orbit is now a theatre of power. States have demonstrated anti-satellite weapons that shatter hard questions into long-lived clouds of debris. China's 2007 ASAT test produced thousands of fragments that still endanger satellites and crew. India and Russia followed with their own destructive tests, normalising an orbital arms race with global consequences.

At the same time, private firms have grown into geopolitical actors. Starlink's constellation and its role in Ukraine showed how a corporation can decide, intentionally or not, which communities stay connected in war. Governments now rely on private terminals for battlefield communications and civilian resilience — and that creates new single points of failure.

Finally, algorithms travel. Policing software, biometric databases and predictive models are packaged, sold and exported. They do to governance what mines and pipelines did to land: they reconfigure who has power over life and labour. Firms such as Palantir supply data infrastructures to immigration and policing agencies; biometric companies ship facial recognition systems that governments in the Global South deploy with minimal safeguards.

Put together, these trends form an imperial stack: control of sight in orbit, control of connectivity on the ground, and control of knowledge in data centres. The stack is layered and mutually reinforcing. Break one link and the whole structure still functions. Break the stack and you begin to reclaim sovereignty.

## What Space Militarisation Actually Is

Space militarisation is not a slogan. It is policy, budget lines, and doctrine. It is the creation of services organised for warfighting in orbit. It is anti-satellite weaponry designed to deny enemies use of space. It is the normalisation of commercial platforms as adjuncts of state power.

The U.S. Space Force was established by law on 20 December 2019. Space is now formally a branch of military planning, procurement, and doctrine.

Anti-satellite (ASAT) tests are the clearest symptom. They are deliberately destructive. China's 2007 strike on its own weather satellite created a debris cloud of thousands of fragments. Those fragments circle the Earth for decades. They threaten every craft that travels the common orbital lanes — including scientific satellites and the International Space Station.

ASAT testing is not distant theatre. India's Mission Shakti in 2019 and Russia's 2021 direct-ascent test multiplied debris and normative risk. Each test makes orbit more dangerous and more politicised. The point is simple: when states test weapons in orbit, they turn a shared, fragile commons into a contested, militarised environment. The consequences are global, indiscriminate, and generational.

As one senior U.S. official put it bluntly:

> "It bears repeating: Outer space is not a ‘global commons,' not the ‘common heritage of mankind,' not ‘res communis,' nor is it a public good."
> — Scott Pace, Executive Director of the U.S. National Space Council (2018)

The ideology could not be clearer. Space, once framed as a shared domain, is now treated as territory to be owned, fenced, and secured.

What happens in orbit does not stay there. The same doctrines of control now extend into the digital atmosphere below — the networks, sensors, and data streams that mirror the militarised sky.

## The New Gatekeepers: Private Constellations And Corporate Sovereignty

For a long time, states controlled strategic infrastructure. That is changing. Private firms now own and operate satellite constellations, imagery platforms, and downlink networks. They have the launch capacity, the hardware, the ground stations and the subscriber base. They also have contracts with states.

Take Starlink. Its terminals provided critical connectivity in Ukraine. Western militaries and relief agencies relied on the service. Governments bought or subsidised terminals. That practical reliance revealed a political truth: a private company can become indispensable to national resilience. The Pentagon itself has contracted satellite services.

Dependence creates leverage. When a single corporation provides connectivity, that corporation can be pressured, lobbied — or act on its own judgement — in ways that shape conflict. Reporting since 2022 shows episodes where Starlink's coverage decisions had direct battlefield implications and where company leadership intervened in ways that alarmed officials.

Commercial imagery platforms are similar gatekeepers. Companies collect high-resolution pictures of the planet. They sell to states, NGOs, and journalists. They also restrict access. The colonial logic is present here too: those who pay get to look; others are cut out of the view.

Western tech corporations have become the new charter companies — armed not with muskets but launch capacity, cloud contracts, and orbital monopolies. SpaceX, Amazon, and OneWeb control the orbital lanes through launch capacity and constellations; Microsoft and Google dominate the cloud backbones that route military and civilian data alike. The Pentagon, NATO, and EU institutions buy these services directly. War has been outsourced to code and subscription models. The customer is the state, but the leverage belongs to the corporation.

Private ownership of infrastructure does not automatically mean malice. It means power concentrated in private hands, with weak democratic checks. In a crisis, that concentration becomes a decision point about life and death.

Their control of orbit mirrors another frontier: control of data itself.

## AI Colonialism: Data As The New Extraction

The nineteenth-century colony mined land. The twenty-first-century colony mines data — and it does so through the same infrastructure that militarised the sky.

"Data colonialism" describes how corporations and states extract behavioural traces, biometric markers, and social graphs. They convert people into datasets and sell the patterns to power.

The frontier of this corporate empire lies in code. U.S. and European technology firms now provide the surveillance, analytics, and machine-learning systems that shape policing, border control, and welfare governance across the Global South. What once came as gunboats now arrives as software licences and cloud credits.

AI colonialism works through three channels.

**Surveillance export.**
Corporations export kits — cameras, databases, analytic models — that enable mass surveillance. Chinese firms and platforms have been central to this export model across Africa and other regions. Governments buy turnkey systems and, with them, a template for policing and control. Western companies follow the same playbook — IBM, Thales, and various Israeli and European security firms integrate AI surveillance suites for profit and political leverage. This is the ground layer of the imperial stack — the code that governs the bodies once mapped by satellites.

**Security markets.**
Palantir, IBM, and Microsoft Azure Government supply integrated intelligence platforms to Western militaries and allied governments. These contracts embed foreign policy inside proprietary code, ensuring dependence on U.S. infrastructure long after troops withdraw. The same tools that trace money flows trace people. Contracts and investigations show how these systems have been centralised into enforcement architectures.

**Biometric capture.**
Facial recognition companies operate across jurisdictions, facing fines and litigation yet persisting by selling to law enforcement abroad. Clearview's legal battles in Europe and elsewhere illustrate both the scale of data scraping and the gaps in global enforcement.

The net effect completes the circuit. Empire's sightlines now run from orbit to biometric scanners — from the satellite image to the human face.

## Material Supply Chains And The Carbon Cost Of The Imperial Stack

The digital and the orbital are not weightless. Satellites require rare metals and energy-intensive manufacturing. Data centres consume vast electricity and depend on cheap land and labour. The physical footprints fall largely on the Global South — mines in the Congo for cobalt, mineral supply chains for semiconductors, and extraction of fuels that power launches and server farms. The "clean" aura of tech obscures the extraction that makes it possible.

Every satellite launch and every GPU cluster represents a value chain that ends in Western stock markets. The minerals come from the periphery; the profits flow to Silicon Valley, London, and Frankfurt. Extraction is still the grammar of empire — only the syntax has changed.

The imperial stack is not abstract. It is built on Congolese cobalt, Bolivian lithium, and sacrificed land. Its circuits and satellites are the new plantations.

## The Legal Vacuum And Normative Failure

International law has gaps. The Outer Space Treaty (1967) sets basic principles, but it does not prevent the weaponisation we now see. There is no enforceable arms control regime for ASATs that limits debris-creating tests. There is no binding international law that governs private providers' role in conflicts or guarantees connectivity as a public good.

The law has failed in both orbits and data streams. The Outer Space Treaty cannot restrain the militarisation of orbit, and privacy regimes cannot restrain the militarisation of data.

Corporations exploit jurisdictional arbitrage. Surveillance systems and AI models are exported under weak accountability frameworks. The result is a field where technical capability outstrips democratic control.

Without law and enforceable norms, the imperial stack grows in darkness. That darkness becomes a terrain for both state and corporate impunity.

## What Resistance Looks Like — A Tactical Agenda

If empire builds a stack, we should build counter-infrastructure and politics that deny it the levers of power. This is practical, not dreamy.

**Ban debris-making tests and demand an orbital arms control treaty.**
The long-term health of the orbital commons matters to everyone. States must negotiate binding constraints on ASAT tests that generate persistent debris and threaten civil and scientific missions.

**Public control of critical infrastructure.**
Treat core connectivity as a public utility. National governments must hold the power to ensure continuous civilian access in crises. Contracts that place connectivity in private hands without safeguards are strategic errors. Demand parliamentary hearings when space firms hold outsized control.

**Bind private actors to public accountability.**
Corporations that provide battlefield or domestic surveillance capabilities must be regulated. That means transparency on contracts, on takedown requests, and on governmental asks to disable services. It means liability when corporate actions cause harm.

**Stop the export of repressive AI.**
Impose moratoria or strict export controls on biometric and mass surveillance systems until human-rights safeguards are in place. Support grassroots digital sovereignty: community networks, public data commons, and cooperative ISPs.

**Tie tech to reparative finance.**
The profits from space launches, satellite data and AI tools are concentrated. A fraction of that revenue should fund technology transfer, local manufacturing, and environmental repair in producer territories. Reparative finance is not charity. It is the correction of an asymmetry that now extends into orbit and server racks.

Resistance must mirror the stack: for every layer of control, build a layer of liberation — public, democratic, and planetary.

## Reclaiming Sightlines And Sovereignty

Empire always needs a way to see, to speak and to make decisions about other people's lives. Once, that required navies and embassies. Today it requires satellites, servers and scored data.

If the Global South and its allies do not push back, the next generation of imperial control will be invisible and total. It will not look like nineteenth-century conquest. It will look bureaucratic, technical and inevitable. That is the trap.

Reclaiming sovereignty means returning the means of sight and speech to publics, not corporations. It means binding these powerful new actors to accountability and law. It means refusing the simple binary that technology is neutral. Technology is political. It encodes values. It can be turned toward justice.

Empire today wears venture-capital logos and defence insignia. Its anthem is the startup pitch.

Fight for laws that prevent debris-making tests. Fight for public control of connectivity. Fight for bans on the export of tools that enable surveillance states. Fight for workers and miners whose labour builds our orbiting future. Fight for a world where connectivity and knowledge are commons, not commodities.

The sky may have new instruments. But if we act, it will not remain an exclusive domain of empire.
And if we build our own — public, shared, accountable — we reclaim the right to see and to be seen on our own terms.

— In solidarity with engineers, activists, miners, and all communities building alternatives to tech domination.
