## The Alliance of the Isolated

Israel’s relationship with apartheid South Africa was more than tactical expediency: it was a sustained partnership of arms, intelligence and nuclear cooperation (or attempted cooperation) that supplied tools and doctrine for repression. This became a model of how settler states normalise violence through secrecy and mutual legitimation.

## Isolation Breeds Complicity

This isn’t academic hair-splitting. We’re talking about material support: weapons, technology, uranium and possibly nuclear know-how, all of which helped a regime keep millions under violent, racial rule. The relationship grew when both states found themselves internationally isolated: South Africa under sanctions and Israel under intense regional pressure. That political loneliness created an incentive structure for covert cooperation, trade and the transfer of repressive expertise. The clearest documentary shock came in 2010 when secret apartheid-era papers were reported to show Israel had offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa. The Israeli presidency denied the claim, but it marked a significant archival revelation.

## From Diplomacy to Covert Alliance

Contacts between Israel and South Africa date to the early post-1948 era, but cooperation deepened dramatically after the 1960s as each state faced diplomatic pressure. Israel’s arms industry expanded, specializing in rugged, exportable systems; South Africa needed weapons, training and technical expertise to survive a regional insurgency environment and bypass sanctions. The relationship’s intensity rose in the 1970s and 1980s, especially after the Likud government in Israel (post-1977) favoured a harder realpolitik posture that translated into pragmatic security arrangements with pariah regimes. Scholars reconstructing the archive show a pattern: formal rhetoric of distance combined with abundant covert and commercial ties.

This was not simply transactional. The alliance reflected a larger logic: settler states share policing and counter-insurgency practices, and when international norms bite, secrecy becomes the lubricant for ongoing repression. For activists and decolonial thinkers today, that structural lesson is what keeps the history urgent.

## Arms, Intelligence, and Uranium

### A Secret Arms Pipeline

Israel became a major supplier of weapons, components and training to South Africa, from small arms and ammunition to aircraft parts and missile technology. Arms embargoes and sanctions pushed both sides into covert channels, secret corporate arrangements and third-party rerouting to hide shipments. These supplies were not abstract: they strengthened the South African Defence Force (SADF) and police units that enforced apartheid at home and intervened militarily across the region. Polakow-Suransky’s archival work and South African publishing archives document these commercial and technical links.

### Exporting Repression

Beyond hardware, there was a flow of doctrine and technical know-how: counter-insurgency methods, interrogation practices, and policing techniques that treated populations as security problems. These “soft” exports—training programmes, advisory exchanges, and surveillance tech transfers—are harder to quantify in a single file, but contemporary investigations and memoirs place them at the core of the relationship. That knowledge transfer helped professionalise repression, turning ad-hoc violence into bureaucratised systems of control.

### The Nuclear Shadow

This is the most explosive, and contested, part of the story. In 2010, secret apartheid-era documents reported by _The Guardian_ suggested Israel offered to sell nuclear warheads to South Africa. This is the strongest archival evidence yet of nuclear-level discussions. Separately, the 22 September 1979 “Vela incident”—a double flash detected by a US Vela satellite over the South Atlantic—has long been suspected as an atmospheric nuclear test, possibly the product of a joint Israeli–South African effort. Declassified US documents and expert reviews (compiled by the National Security Archive and analyses at the Wilson Center) show that many US analysts concluded the probability of a test was high, though official positions remain ambiguous and parts of the record are still redacted. Be explicit: the Vela case is not proven beyond doubt, but the balance of released archival material has pushed more scholars toward the hypothesis that the double-flash was a man-made test, and that cooperation between Israel and South Africa is a plausible explanation.

## The Human and Ecological Cost

These transfers had real victims. Weapons and counter-insurgency methods enabled mass detentions, disappearances, and lethal crackdowns inside South Africa and in neighbouring countries. Militarisation distorted economies: money flowed into arms and surveillance rather than housing, health or education. Environmental harms followed, notably around uranium mining and militarised land use. The legacy is long: communities fractured, truth contested, and ecological scars left where extraction and militarism intersected. Any credible account must tie the diplomatic and technical records back to ordinary lives harmed by state violence. For many in the Global South, the archive is not an academic curiosity; it is a ledger of suffering.

## Breaking the Secrecy Machine

Anti-apartheid mobilisations, international sanctions, and solidarity campaigns eventually helped isolate Pretoria and expose some of these ties. Truth commissions and later archival releases have filled in parts of the record, but not all. Some questions remain classified; key episodes (like aspects of the Vela debate) are still debated. The political lesson is clear: secrecy and economic leverage protect abuses until popular pressure and transparency break the networks that sustain them. For contemporary solidarity with Palestine, the history is a warning. Arms, surveillance tech and “security” expertise are portable commodities that, when paired with diplomatic shielding, make oppression resilient. Watch the supply lines and name the actors.

## Lessons for the Global South

The Israel–apartheid South Africa story is a case study in how states under moral and diplomatic pressure trade in secrecy, repressing people with tools supplied by partners who benefit strategically or commercially. Naming that history matters because it breaks the impunity shield. Public records, archives and vigilant movements are what dismantle these systems. If you oppose settler colonial violence and globalised repression, the task is straightforward: follow the money and the arms, demand declassification, and build transnational pressure so secrecy can no longer buy silences.

— In solidarity with those who resisted, and with Palestine.
