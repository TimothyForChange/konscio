excerpt: 'The Congo Basin is the Earth’s second lung, absorbing billions of tonnes of carbon each year. Yet it is being sacrificed for profit — through logging, mining, and false “green” promises. This is not just an environmental crisis; it is a struggle for justice, sovereignty, and survival.'

# The Congo Basin: Africa’s Lungs Under Siege

The Congo Basin is often called the _lungs of Africa_ — a rainforest so vast it helps the planet breathe. Stretching across six nations and covering more than **200 million hectares**, it absorbs roughly **1.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year**, regulating rainfall across the continent and anchoring global climate stability.[^1]

Yet these forests are being destroyed by the same forces that have long plundered the region’s minerals: profit, imperial power and a colonial imagination that treats Africa as a warehouse of resources rather than a home of living communities.

This is not merely a story about trees. It is a story about **who decides the fate of the planet’s last frontiers** — and who bears the cost of their destruction.

## The New Scramble for the Forest

From Kinshasa to Brazzaville to Yaoundé, governments are auctioning off logging concessions, oil blocks and “sustainable development” projects that carve deep scars into one of Earth’s most vital ecosystems.

French logging giants, Chinese mining firms and Western-backed agribusinesses are all vying for control. Roads and rail lines slice through once-intact forest corridors. Palm oil plantations expand under the banner of “green growth”. Even the World Bank and IMF promote timber exports as a path to “poverty reduction”.

It is, in truth, a **new Scramble for Africa** — only now the spoils are measured in hectares of rainforest and tonnes of carbon, not rubber and ivory. The same imperial logic that once divided the Congo River Basin at the Berlin Conference now divides it through trade deals, concessions and carbon markets.

The Congo Basin contains roughly **25% of the world’s tropical forest carbon stock**.[^2] Cutting it is not just a regional loss — it is a planetary emergency.

## The Mirage of “Sustainable Logging”

Western governments and corporations often insist that “sustainable forestry” and “offset programmes” will protect the Congo Basin. In reality, these mechanisms entrench exploitation under a veneer of environmental responsibility.

Carbon credit schemes such as **REDD+** (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) allow polluters in the Global North to continue emitting greenhouse gases while claiming to “offset” their pollution by paying for forest conservation in the South.

In practice, this means **climate finance replaces colonial tribute**: money flows northward in the form of credits, while local communities lose access to the land they have cared for over generations. Forests become commodities, not commons. The atmosphere becomes a marketplace, not a shared inheritance.

Recent investigations show that new “carbon concessions” in the DRC often **overlap Indigenous territories** and are negotiated **without Free, Prior and Informed Consent** — in some cases rebranded from former logging concessions.[^3] This is carbon colonialism under a green banner.

> “Carbon trading and offsets are simply the privatization of the atmosphere. They allow polluters to buy the right to continue polluting.”

## Human Cost: Dispossession and Resistance

For Indigenous peoples of the Congo Basin — the Baka, Batwa, BaAka and many others — the forest is life. It is their medicine cabinet, their school, their temple. Yet in the name of conservation and carbon trading, entire communities are evicted from ancestral lands.

“Protected areas” and logging concessions alike often come with military enforcement. Armed guards patrol lands once open to hunting and gathering. Those who resist are criminalised as “poachers”. Those who protest risk imprisonment or worse.

UN and NGO reports have documented **violent evictions and abuses by eco-guards** funded by major international conservation groups, including WWF, in the DRC and Republic of Congo.[^4] These operations mirror the extractive logic they claim to oppose.

Despite this violence, resistance endures. Indigenous women’s networks in Itombwe and Equateur lead **community reforestation projects** and protest illegal logging. Youth groups document forest crimes with GPS tools, and community associations are demanding **legal recognition of collective land rights**. Across the Basin, ordinary people assert a radical truth: _living with the forest is not backwardness — it is wisdom._

## Ecocide and Global Consequences

Scientists warn that the Congo Basin could soon flip from a **carbon sink to a carbon source** if deforestation and degradation continue. Central African forests are already absorbing **half as much CO₂** as they did in the 1990s, and without protection could emit more than they store within decades.[^5]

The consequences are global. The Basin’s forests recycle **75–95% of their own rainfall** and generate up to **17% of West Africa’s rain** through evapotranspiration, feeding weather systems as far away as the Sahel and Ethiopian Highlands.[^6] Its loss would destabilise rainfall, intensify droughts and floods, and accelerate planetary heating.

To destroy the Congo Basin is not simply to lose biodiversity. It is to dismantle one of the Earth’s last living climate regulators — a planetary lung collapsing under the weight of capital.

## The Politics of False Solutions

Global North governments congratulate themselves for funding “forest protection” programmes — but the fine print tells another story.

Conservation is outsourced to Western NGOs. Profits are privatised, while decision-making remains in foreign hands. Local knowledge is ignored; local sovereignty is denied.

The climate movement in the North often repeats this pattern: demanding emission cuts at home while remaining silent about the corporate pillage of the Global South. This selective environmentalism treats African land as a carbon sponge, not as territory inhabited by people with political rights.

True climate justice requires more than technological fixes or carbon markets. It demands a **redistribution of power** — political, economic and ecological.

## Toward Climate Sovereignty

To protect the Congo Basin is to challenge the system that endangers it.
That means recognising the right of forest peoples to govern their land. It means rejecting extractive “green growth” models. It means reparative climate finance — not charity, but justice.

A genuinely eco-socialist approach would:

- **Return control** of forests to Indigenous and local communities through recognition of collective land rights and **Free, Prior and Informed Consent**.[^7]
- **End export dependency** by building sustainable, locally rooted economies.
- **Hold corporations accountable** through binding international law and transparent supply chains.
- **Demand degrowth** in the Global North, where overconsumption drives destruction elsewhere.

Protecting the Congo Basin is not an act of altruism. It is an act of **planetary self-defence**.

## Closing: The Pulse of the Planet

The forest breathes for all life. Its rivers carry the memory of millions of years. Its canopy shelters more than **10,000 plant species**, nearly **30% of them unique to the region**, and over **400 mammals and 1,000 bird species**.[^8] More than **150 ethnic groups**, including BaAka, BaMbuti and Efe peoples, depend on it for their survival.

Yet it is being silenced by chainsaws, pipelines and profit.

If we allow the Basin to die, we will have allowed a part of ourselves to die with it.

> “Wake up, humanity! We are out of time. We must shake our conscience free of the rapacious capitalism, racism, and patriarchy that are destroying the Earth.”
> — _Berta Cáceres, Indigenous Lenca environmental defender (assassinated 3 March 2016)_

The fate of the Congo Basin is not a regional concern — it is the moral and ecological question of our time.
Will humanity continue to consume the planet’s lungs, or will we finally learn to breathe in solidarity?

— In solidarity with the peoples of the Congo Basin and all who defend life on Earth.
