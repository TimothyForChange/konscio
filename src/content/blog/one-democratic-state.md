# One Land, One Future: The Case for a Single Democratic State

If the first two parts of this series set out the problem and traced the global scaffolding that keeps it standing, this final instalment argues for a political solution consistent with justice.

We bypass the failed paradigm of a two-state solution because that model—rooted in partition—inherently legitimises the core dispossession of 1948 and is structurally incapable of delivering the equality and restitution that justice requires. That solution is a single democratic polity for everyone who lives **between the river and the sea** — a rights-based state that guarantees equality, secures minority protections, and implements reparative measures for dispossession.

This is not a fantasy; it is a political programme grounded in universal rights and in the hard realities we identified earlier. Below are the core elements of a one-state framework and how political actors might move toward it.

## What a Single Democratic State Means in Practice

A one-state solution can take multiple constitutional forms — unitary secular state, federal or confederal models, or a binational arrangement with strong protections. The essential shared principle is **equal citizenship**: civil, political and social rights guaranteed irrespective of ethnicity or religion.

Key institutional features would include:

- **A bill of rights** guaranteeing equality before law, freedom of worship and cultural protections.
- **An independent judiciary** with constitutional review powers to enforce rights.
- **Power-sharing and decentralisation** so local governance protects community life and cultural autonomy.
- **Transitional justice mechanisms** — truth commissions, reparations schemes and legal redress for dispossessed communities, **centrally including the implementation of the Palestinian Right ofReturn.** [^1]

## Addressing the Hard Objections

**Security.** Transition must protect civilians and prevent genocide or revenge violence. That requires phased demilitarisation, internationally monitored security arrangements, community policing models and guarantees that limit unilateral use of force. These steps must be paired with disarmament and security sector reform.

**Majoritarian fear.** Safeguards can include constitutional minority rights, veto protections on critical issues, and institutional arrangements (bicameral legislatures with territorial representation, judicial safeguards). Democracy does not mean the tyranny of a simple majority if institutions are designed to protect pluralism.

**Economic transition.** Devising reparations, land restitution, and economic redistribution is politically fraught but necessary. International funds — framed as reparative climate or development finance — can support reconstruction, land restoration and economic inclusion. Redistribution must be democratic and transparent, prioritising restitution to dispossessed populations and funding public goods.

## Practical Steps Toward a Unified Future

The goal must be built through incremental, mutually reinforcing actions:

1. **Grassroots cross-communal organising.** Political change begins with networks of solidarity — municipal alliances, civil-society coalitions and rights-based movements that demand inclusion.
2. **Legal groundwork.** Strategic litigation, documentation and rights-based advocacy build the jurisprudence of equality. International courts and domestic suit-cases create pressure and legal precedents. [^2]
3. **International measures.** Arms embargoes, conditional assistance and corporate accountability increase the cost of maintaining asymmetrical rule.
4. **Constitutional conventions and transitional processes.** **When these pressures make the status quo unviable and create a political rupture,** inclusive constitutional conventions — with international guarantees — can draft frameworks that reflect plural claims and guarantee protections.
5. **Economic programmes for restitution and inclusion.** Reparations, land reform and public investment address material legacies of dispossession.

Each step is politically demanding. But planning, coalition building and international solidarity make them feasible in principle.

## A Politics of Imagination and Accountability

One-state politics is not about erasing identity. It is about building institutions where identities flourish without domination. It asks uncomfortable things of all actors: **the settler population** must relinquish privilege; states must accept legal liability; international actors must move from convenience to accountability.

This is the labour of decolonisation: not simply shifting borders but dismantling the institutions of supremacy and building democratic modes of cohabitation in their place, **securing a just future for all, from the river to the sea.**

— In solidarity with Palestinian struggles for self-determination, dignity and equal rights.
