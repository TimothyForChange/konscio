# Health Is Not a Privilege: Why South Africa Needs the NHI

Every day, South Africans queue for hours in under-staffed clinics. Mothers sleep on chairs beside hospital beds because wards are overcrowded. Nurses work double shifts with broken equipment and no protection. This is not bad luck or “inefficiency”. It is structural violence — a system where survival depends on income, and poverty is punished with death.

The National Health Insurance (NHI) is not just a policy proposal. It is a moral test. It asks whether South Africa will keep treating healthcare as a commodity or finally accept it as a right.

## The Unfinished Struggle for Health Justice

The divide between public and private care is the clearest proof that apartheid never ended — it was privatised. During apartheid, health services were segregated by race. After 1994, the new democracy inherited two systems: one for the poor and one for the insured. The rich moved into medical aid schemes subsidised by tax breaks. The poor were left to queue for care in collapsing facilities.

For three decades, this inequality has deepened. Private hospitals now absorb almost half of all national health spending while serving less than 20 percent of the population. The public system serves everyone else with the remaining half. It is an economic mirror of apartheid geography — well-resourced suburbs on one side, neglected townships and rural districts on the other.

The NHI, signed into law in May 2024, promises to break that divide. It would pool public and private funds into one national system. Every South African would be entitled to quality healthcare regardless of income or location. It is the most ambitious social reform since 1994 and one of the few that could make the Constitution’s promise of “health for all” real.

## Who Opposes It and Why

Power never gives up profit voluntarily. The loudest critics of the NHI are those who benefit from the current two-tier system. Private hospital corporations, medical aid administrators, and their political allies argue that the NHI will “collapse healthcare” and “chase away doctors”. What they fear is not collapse but equity.

Business lobbies warn that the plan is “unaffordable”. They mean unaffordable _for them_. The same voices that cheer corporate tax cuts suddenly discover fiscal prudence when redistribution is on the table. Discovery Health spends millions on marketing but cries poverty when asked to share resources. Treasury officials speak of “growth constraints” while ignoring that austerity itself has killed growth.

The liberal opposition wraps this defence of privilege in moral language. They call it “freedom of choice”. But in a country where most people cannot afford medical aid, that “choice” is a lie. The DA and its think-tank allies portray the NHI as state overreach, warning of a “Cuban-style monopoly”. In truth, they are protecting a private monopoly — one that turns human suffering into profit.

Healthcare should not depend on the generosity of the market. It should depend on the dignity of the person.

## What the NHI Promises

The NHI’s core idea is simple: universal coverage through shared funding. Instead of paying private premiums, citizens contribute through progressive taxation. The national fund then purchases services from both public and private providers.

Done well, this model offers major gains:

- **Equity:** Every person receives care according to need, not income.
- **Efficiency:** Centralised purchasing reduces duplication and waste.
- **Solidarity:** The healthy support the sick, and society recognises that everyone will need care eventually.
- **Decolonisation:** It ends the colonial logic that sees world-class medicine as the birthright of the rich and rationed care as the fate of the poor.

Universal healthcare is not charity. It is the collective expression of dignity. It recognises that illness is not a personal failure but a social condition shaped by poverty, pollution, and work. The NHI gives that truth institutional form.

## The Challenges Ahead

Still, no illusion is useful. The NHI faces serious obstacles.

**State capacity** is fragile. Corruption, mismanagement, and low morale have hollowed out the public system. Passing a law is easier than running a hospital. Infrastructure upgrades, staff recruitment, and transparent procurement will take sustained commitment.

**Fiscal constraint** is real but political. The Treasury resists wealth taxes and prefers austerity, claiming there is no money. Yet billions are lost each year to corporate profit-shifting, elite bailouts, and wasteful defence spending. South Africa does not lack resources — it lacks redistribution.

**Administrative complexity** is another risk. The NHI will rely on vast data systems for patient records, payments, and provider accreditation. If this technology is outsourced to private vendors, corruption will follow. The state must build open, auditable systems that serve the public interest.

**Legal resistance** will also come. Private healthcare companies and medical schemes are preparing constitutional challenges. They will fight to protect their market share, slowing implementation through the courts.

All these challenges are surmountable. None justify abandoning the goal.

## How to Make It Work

The government can deliver if it acts with clarity and courage.

**1. Secure sustainable funding.** Redirect medical aid tax credits into the NHI Fund. Introduce a modest wealth tax on the top one percent. Use progressive payroll contributions tied to income. Transparency will win public trust.

**2. Rebuild the workforce.** Hire thousands of unemployed doctors, nurses, and community health workers. End the casualisation of healthcare labour. Training without employment is national sabotage.

**3. Fix infrastructure fast.** Many facilities need running water, electricity, and basic equipment before anything else. Public works projects can upgrade clinics while creating jobs — the most direct form of stimulus.

**4. Protect the data commons.** Build open-source, locally controlled digital systems. Every transaction must be traceable. Public technology is public accountability.

**5. Empower communities.** Health committees, unions, and patient associations should monitor clinics and report failures. Decentralised oversight is the only vaccine against corruption.

**6. Change the political narrative.** Stop apologising for redistribution. Remind citizens that the Constitution already guarantees the right to healthcare. The NHI is how that right becomes real.

## The Pace Problem

Implementation is slow. Regulations are expected in 2025. The NHI Fund may only become operational in 2026. Full coverage could take a decade or more.

This delay is not technical necessity but political hesitation. When elites need rescuing, the state moves overnight. When the poor need dignity, everything becomes a “phased approach”. The government must treat health with the same urgency it treats debt repayment. Lives are being lost while committees deliberate.

Speed, however, must not mean secrecy. The rollout should be public, accountable, and participatory. If people see tangible improvements — shorter queues, working equipment, humane service — trust will grow faster than any marketing campaign.

## What the NHI Means for the People

For millions, this reform is the difference between living and dying. It means a miner’s widow can access chemotherapy without selling her home. It means a child in a rural village receives the same care as a banker’s son in Sandton. It means nurses are respected as public servants, not exploited as cheap labour.

The NHI embodies the principle of collective care. In a society fractured by inequality, it is one of the few policies that can rebuild solidarity. When everyone contributes and everyone benefits, social trust can begin to return.

But that future will not arrive by decree. It will be fought for. Civil society must defend the NHI against sabotage and dilution. Unions must demand jobs and fair pay. Activists must expose corruption before it rots the system from within.

A just health system will not be handed down — it will be built from below.

## Health, Ecology, and Liberation

Eco-socialism teaches that the struggle for human health and the struggle for planetary health are the same fight. The same logic that poisons rivers and air also underfunds hospitals and treats workers as disposable. A society that values profit over life will destroy both people and planet.

The NHI challenges that logic. It asserts that life is not a line item in a budget. It insists that care is a public good. It reminds us that solidarity is not sentiment but structure.

If South Africa can make the NHI work, it will prove that a post-colonial society can build universal systems of care without surrendering to neoliberal fatalism. It will show that democracy is more than voting — it is the collective organisation of life.

## Closing Reflection

A nation that treats healing as a privilege has surrendered its soul. The NHI is not a gift from the state; it is a debt owed to the people.

Good healthcare is a human right. It belongs to everyone, from the cities to the rural clinics, from the insured to the excluded. Making it real will demand courage, honesty, and relentless pressure.

The task is vast, but the principle is simple: **a society that refuses to care for its people is already sick.**
