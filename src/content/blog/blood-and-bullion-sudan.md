excerpt: 'Sudan’s war is not only fought with bullets and tanks — it is fuelled by gold. The RSF’s control of mines and the UAE’s central role in the trade reveal how extraction, not ideology, drives modern imperial violence. To end the war, we must choke the profits and dismantle the system that turns land and lives into bullion.'

# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan’s War

Gold doesn’t only glitter — in Sudan it bankrolls bullets, sieges and dispossession. **This war is a fight between two rival kleptocracies:** the Sudanese Armed Forces’ (SAF) entrenched, state-based economic empire, and the predatory, gold-fuelled war economy of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF has turned extraction into a war economy: controlling mines, harvesting cash, and converting land and lives into bullion that flows out through regional trade routes. At the far end of that chain sit Gulf and international markets — most notably the United Arab Emirates — whose appetite for opaque gold supplies helps keep the violence alive. Follow the money and you’ll find the modern face of neocolonial extraction.

## The RSF: From Janjaweed to Mineralised Power

The RSF’s origins in Janjaweed militias and its elevation under Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo mean the force is as much a predatory commercial actor as a fighting unit. Over the last half-decade, control of mining zones — especially in Darfur and northern Sudan — shifted from ad-hoc looting to institutionalised revenue generation. Controlling mines gives the RSF territorial leverage, immediate cash and bargaining power in Khartoum and with external patrons. That is why extraction matters: when territorial control equals revenue, the logic of conflict changes — peace threatens profit.

## How Much Gold — and Where It Goes

Analyses and field reports point to significant volumes. **An estimated 10 tonnes of gold** were extracted from RSF-controlled areas in 2024 — roughly **US $860 million** in value. Gold is portable, high value per weight and easy to launder; that makes it ideal for financing irregular forces.
The **UAE is the dominant destination**, with **about 97 percent of official gold exports from SAF-held zones** in 2023 going there, worth around **US $1.5 billion**. Smaller volumes move through neighbouring states such as **Egypt, Chad and South Sudan**, often serving as smuggling corridors rather than final markets. The true total — including informal and smuggled output — is likely several times higher, with estimates suggesting that **50 to 80 percent of total production** is exported off the books.

## The UAE’s Role: Market, Leverage and Denial

Investigations and UN reporting have repeatedly identified Emirati firms and intermediaries at the end of Sudan’s gold supply chains. Some shipments have been linked to networks that also move materiel, though the **UAE officially denies any direct provision of weapons to the RSF.**
The economic connection, however, is clear: **Gulf demand and refinery capacity give enormous monetary value** to seizing Sudanese mines. When the UAE suspended flights and tightened import controls on Sudanese gold in October 2025, the **Sudanese pound fell by roughly 40 percent** against the dollar within two weeks — a stark indicator of how dependent the war economy had become on those exports.

## From Mine to Militia: How Cash Fuels the War

The chain is simple and brutal: RSF (or RSF-aligned brokers) control a mine → local traders buy rough gold → cross-border brokers and refiners move the metal through neighbouring states → bullion dealers in Gulf markets buy or refine it into standard bars for resale.
Cash then flows rapidly back into RSF coffers to **pay fighters, buy fuel, and maintain patronage networks.** High global gold prices since 2023 have supercharged this cycle, turning artisanal mining zones that once provided subsistence livelihoods into **militarised extraction frontiers.**

## Extraction as Ecocide: The Human and Ecological Cost

Wartime mining is ecocide in slow motion. Artisanal pits scar landscapes; **ore-processing often uses mercury and cyanide**, with little to no regulation, contaminating water and farmland. Exposure has been linked by local NGOs to neurological and developmental harm in nearby communities. Farmland and grazing lands are destroyed, and unregulated pits multiply, creating long-term hazards.
Human-rights observers have documented **forced displacement, sexual violence and summary executions** around mining areas. Extraction thus produces a **triple assault — physical violence, economic dispossession and ecological ruin.**

## A Decolonial Reading: Who Profits and Who Pays?

This is structural, not accidental. Local strongmen and brokers capture resource rents; regional intermediaries and Gulf buyers monetise them; multinational refiners and traders integrate bullion into global markets. Wealth flows out; the social and ecological costs remain. That pattern is the persistence of colonial extraction in new clothing: dispossession rather than settlement, financial intermediation rather than direct colonial administration.

An eco-socialist lens points us to the levers of power. Treating the crisis as merely a security problem misses the economic incentives that sustain it. The RSF won’t disarm while gold keeps funding it; **foreign buyers won’t change behaviour while opaque profit and laundering opportunities remain.** Ending the war requires dismantling the commercial architecture that makes mine control so valuable.

## What Must Change: Policy Demands

A decolonial solidarity programme must centre enforceable measures that target buyers and enablers, not ordinary miners.

- **Binding traceability and due diligence**
  Require provenance documentation for all gold entering consumer markets. Strengthen conflict-minerals frameworks to cover gold with legal obligations on refiners and downstream buyers.

- **Targeted financial sanctions**
  Impose designations and asset freezes on middlemen, brokers and companies identified as facilitating illicit flows — while shielding ordinary miners and communities from collateral harm.

- **Banking and AML enforcement in transit hubs**
  Regulators in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other hubs must enforce anti-money-laundering provisions for bullion dealers and correspondent banks. Where financial institutions process suspicious flows, they must face consequences.

- **Support for local documentation, land rights and remediation**
  Fund Sudanese civil society groups documenting abuses; back community land-rights programmes and participatory environmental remediation; and prioritise reparations and restitution for affected communities.

- **Legal accountability where evidence exists**
  Where credible evidence shows arms or logistical support in breach of UN resolutions or international law, pursue legal scrutiny through appropriate international mechanisms. Follow the money as rigorously as weapons transfers.

## Solidarity Tactics for Activists and Movements

If you want to end the war, pressure the markets, not the victims.
Effective tactics include: naming and shaming refineries and exchanges that accept unverified gold; shareholder campaigns targeting refiners and bullion houses; FOI-based pressure where public institutions obscure trade; and coordinated petitions to central banks and regulators.
Crucially, centre Sudanese voices and demands — supply-chain transparency and reparations must be defined by those harmed.

## Conclusion — Follow the Bullion

This conflict is not only about rival generals and contested state power. It’s about a political economy that turns people and ecosystems into extractable value. Gold — portable, valuable and easy to monetise — has become the fuel of Sudan’s war. Gulf markets and actors who profit from opaque trade flows are not innocent bystanders: their demand makes the seizure of land worth the cost.

To stop the fighting we must choke the profits. That means enforceable traceability, targeted sanctions on enablers, banking and regulatory accountability in transit hubs, and a decolonial politics that centres Sudanese demands for restitution and democratic control over resources. **This strategy is essential for cutting the RSF’s most profitable lifeline — though a key risk remains the diversion of this trade to other global actors, like Russia or China, who actively subvert transparency efforts.**

Follow the money. It points to where the war will end — if we have the political will to take it apart.
