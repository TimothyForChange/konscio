# Complicity and Power: How the World Sustains the Occupation

If the first part of this series mapped the architecture of dispossession, this second instalment examines the scaffolding that props it up. Occupation and settler expansion are not self-sustaining; they are made possible by international actors who supply weapons, political cover and economic integration — and by institutions that fail to hold perpetrators to account.

Understanding these channels is a political act: it shows where leverage exists and where transnational pressure can break the machinery of dispossession.

## Diplomatic shielding and the politics of enforcement

Throughout the post-1948 period, diplomatic decisions shaped outcomes. Powerful states used vetoes, rhetorical shelter and military support to protect a policy matrix that privileges settler control. This is not purely a matter of choice — it is the consequence of geopolitical alliances and entrenched political interests that have repeatedly softened international responses to occupation-related abuses.

International institutions offer mechanisms of accountability in theory, but in practice enforcement is uneven. Resolutions are passed while critical economic and military ties remain untouched; legal complaints are filed while diplomatic pressure is muted. This asymmetry normalises impunity.

## Arms, finance and the military-industrial dimension

Weapons and military finance are the material means of occupation. Large suppliers maintain the military capacity that enforces checkpoints, demolitions and blockade regimes. Open-source reporting and defence analyses document extensive sales and security cooperation that replenish the tools of control.

Moreover, defence and security industries have commercial incentives to preserve conflict-driven markets. The flow of arms and surveillance technologies links corporate profit to the perpetuation of control, creating constituencies opposed to meaningful change.

## Corporate entanglement and supply chains

Economic complicity is not limited to arms. Construction companies, tech firms supplying surveillance systems, and international corporations buying goods or investing in settlement infrastructure all form part of the ecosystem that underpins occupation. Contracts for settlement construction, infrastructure and property management turn dispossession into profit. Shareholder structures and international trading links mean that global capital is entangled with local rights abuses.

Holding corporations accountable — through due diligence laws, targeted sanctions and public campaigns — can shift risk calculations and make certain practices politically costly.

## The leverage that matters

If the architecture of complicity exists, so too do pressure points:

- **Arms embargoes and restrictions** that cut off supplies used for occupation. Recent national arms restrictions show that such measures are politically possible, even if partial.
- **Legal accountability** pursued by civil society and international institutions — documentation, litigation, and evidentiary work that builds cases for sanctions or prosecutions.
- **Targeted economic pressure** on firms directly involved in settlement economies through divestment and corporate litigation.
- **Diplomatic mobilising** that shifts the balance in international fora and generates bespoke penalties for actors who enable dispossession.

These levers are not panaceas. They require political will and international coordination. But they demonstrate that the occupation is not beyond influence; it is sustained by choices that can be reversed or made costly.

## A politics of responsibility

Naming complicity reframes action: it moves the debate from moral exhortation to concrete policy change. That shift matters because it creates obligations on states, corporations and financial institutions to act differently. The global architecture that tolerates occupation does so because the costs of complicity have been low. If those costs rise — through sanctions, legal risk or reputational harm — the calculus can change.

Part Three will set out political alternatives: what justice-oriented solutions look like when they seek not to manage dispossession but to dismantle the institutions that reproduce it.

— In solidarity with Palestinian struggles for self-determination, dignity and equal rights.
