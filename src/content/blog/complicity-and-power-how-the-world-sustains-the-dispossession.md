# Complicity and Power: How the World Sustains Dispossession

If the first part of this series mapped the architecture of dispossession, this second instalment examines the scaffolding that props it up. **This system of** dispossession and settler expansion **is** not self-sustaining; **it is** made possible by international actors who supply weapons, political cover and economic integration — and by institutions that fail to hold perpetrators to account.

Understanding these channels is a political act: it shows where leverage exists and where transnational pressure can break the machinery of dispossession.

## Diplomatic shielding and the politics of enforcement

Throughout the post-1948 period, diplomatic decisions shaped outcomes. Powerful states, **most visibly through the consistent use of the US veto at the UN Security Council,** used rhetorical shelter and military support to protect a policy matrix that privileges settler control. This is not purely a matter of choice — it is the consequence of geopolitical alliances and entrenched political interests that have repeatedly softened international responses to abuses.

International institutions offer mechanisms of accountability in theory, but in practice enforcement is uneven. Resolutions are passed while critical economic and military ties remain untouched; legal complaints are filed, **such as the current proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC),** while diplomatic pressure is muted. This asymmetry normalises impunity.

## Arms, finance and the military-industrial dimension

Weapons and military finance are the material means of **control**. Large suppliers **— primarily the United States and Germany —** maintain the military capacity that enforces checkpoints, demolitions and blockade regimes. Open-source reporting and defence analyses document extensive sales and security cooperation that replenish the tools of control.

Moreover, defence and security industries have commercial incentives to preserve conflict-driven markets. The flow of arms and surveillance technologies links corporate profit to the perpetuation of control, creating constituencies opposed to meaningful change.

## Corporate entanglement and supply chains

Economic complicity is not limited to arms. Construction companies, tech firms supplying surveillance systems **(such as those used for facial recognition at checkpoints),** and international corporations buying goods or investing in settlement infrastructure all form part of the ecosystem that underpins **dispossession**. Contracts for settlement construction, infrastructure and property management turn dispossession into profit. Shareholder structures and international trading links mean that global capital is entangled with local rights abuses.

Holding corporations accountable — through due diligence laws, targeted sanctions and public campaigns — can shift risk calculations and make certain practices politically costly.

## The leverage that matters

If the architecture of complicity exists, so too do pressure points:

- **Arms embargoes and restrictions** that cut off supplies. **Recent (if partial) arms restrictions or suspensions from states like Belgium, Spain, and Canada** show that such measures are politically possible, even if partial.
- **Legal accountability** pursued by civil society **and states, including South Africa's case at the ICJ and the ICC prosecutor's request for warrants** — documentation, litigation, and evidentiary work that builds cases for sanctions or prosecutions.
- **Targeted economic pressure** on firms directly involved in settlement economies through divestment and corporate litigation, **often driven by public pension funds and civil society campaigns.**
- **Diplomatic mobilising** that shifts the balance in international fora and generates bespoke penalties for actors who enable dispossession.

These levers are not panaceas. They require political will and international coordination. But they demonstrate that the **system** is not beyond influence; it is sustained by choices that can be reversed or made costly.

## A politics of responsibility

Naming complicity reframes action: it moves the debate from moral exhortation to concrete policy change. That shift matters because it creates obligations on states, corporations and financial institutions to act differently. The global architecture that tolerates **this system** does so because the costs of complicity have been low. If those costs rise — through sanctions, legal risk or reputational harm — the calculus can change.

Part Three will set out political alternatives: what justice-oriented solutions look like when they seek not to manage dispossession but to dismantle the institutions that reproduce it.

— In solidarity with Palestinian struggles for self-determination, dignity and equal rights.
