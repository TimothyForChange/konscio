# Why This Blog Exists: For People and Planet

Capitalism, colonialism, and climate collapse are not separate crises — they are one system of domination expressed through different forms. The same logic that enslaved and extracted from the Global South now drives ecological collapse across the planet.

**Timothy for Change** exists to confront that system — not as neutral commentary, but as _critical resistance._

This blog is written from South Africa, in solidarity with all who struggle against empire, exploitation, and environmental destruction. It belongs to the long tradition of liberation thought that insists the fight for human freedom and the fight for ecological survival are one and the same.

## What This Site Stands For

- **Eco-socialism:** A just, post-capitalist world where the economy serves life — not profit.
- **Decolonisation:** Dismantling the political, cultural, and economic power structures inherited from empire.
- **Global South Solidarity:** Centring the voices and struggles of those most exploited and least heard.
- **Structural Analysis:** Naming root causes, not symptoms — because oppression is systemic, not accidental.
- **Liberation:** Real change comes from collective power, not reform handed down from above.

## Why It Matters

We live in a time of planetary emergency — ecological, economic, and moral. The forces that profit from destruction will not dismantle themselves.

The task ahead is not merely to survive, but to _build an alternative_ rooted in justice, cooperation, and care for the Earth. _Timothy for Change_ is a small contribution to that struggle — a space for radical thought, critical analysis, and solidarity across borders.

## What to Expect

This site will feature essays, reflections, and analyses that explore how global systems of power operate — and how they can be dismantled.
It will explore the intersections between:

- Capitalism and ecological breakdown
- Colonialism and global inequality
- Technology and extractivism
- Resistance movements and transformative alternatives

Every post will ask one central question:
**What must change for people and planet to survive — and how do we make it happen?**

## Closing Thought

To write is to resist forgetting.
To analyse is to fight despair with understanding.
To imagine a better world is already an act of defiance.

> _“Liberation is impossible without dismantling the systems that exploit both people and the planet — and that a decolonised, eco-socialist future is not optional, but necessary.”_

Welcome to **Timothy for Change** — for people and planet.
