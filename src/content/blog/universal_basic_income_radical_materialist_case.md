# Universal Basic Income: A Radical, Materialist Case

> "For a colonised people the most essential value, because it is the most concrete, is first and foremost the land: the land which will bring them bread and, above all, dignity."

## What UBI Is — and What It Isn’t

Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a simple idea: everyone receives a regular, unconditional payment from public funds. No means test. No work requirement. No humiliation. Its aim is to guarantee dignity and freedom from destitution.

But simplicity hides struggle. UBI can be emancipatory — or a technocratic patch on a system built on exploitation. When funded and controlled by capital, it subsidises low wages and privatised survival. When grounded in public power, it redistributes wealth, time and ownership.

This essay argues for the second path: a **UBI anchored in ecosocial planning, public provision and decolonial finance** — a basic income that weakens extraction instead of stabilising it.

UBI alone cannot cure poverty. Without structural change, it will be absorbed by profit, rent and debt. But embedded in a democratic programme of public services, debt justice, and ecological planning, it can help shift power from capital to people.

## Why This Debate Matters

Poverty is not natural. It is designed — through austerity, debt adjustment, and trade liberalisation that strip wealth from labour and land to feed accumulation. Wages are suppressed, commons enclosed, and public services gutted.

UBI crystallises a political choice: **manage capitalism’s wreckage or transform its structure.**
Either we continue cushioning exploitation with market-friendly welfare, or we build a system where social policy redistributes power, not just income.

Properly designed, UBI can increase workers’ bargaining power, freeing people from coerced labour and creating time for care, organising and political life. But if extraction and privatisation remain intact, the money will be devoured by landlords, creditors and corporate monopolies.

The question, then, is not whether to support UBI — but **which UBI**, and as part of **what wider transformation**.

---

## What the Evidence Shows

Evidence from pilots is useful but limited. Cash transfers reduce poverty, improve health, and increase economic resilience. Trials in Kenya, Finland and Stockton show clear gains in food security and mental well-being. The lazy worker myth collapses under real data.

Employment effects depend on context. Where strong labour protections and public services exist, UBI increases bargaining power without mass job loss. Where services are privatised and jobs precarious, it becomes a tool for survival, not liberation.

The inflation debate also reveals class politics. Modest transfers don’t trigger inflation; the fear often masks elite anxiety that workers might gain leverage over wages.

The lesson is clear: **cash helps, but structure decides.** Small, token payments stabilise exploitation; universal, adequate income tied to public services shifts power.

## The Trap of a Market-Friendly UBI

When detached from structural reform, UBI repeats three failures.

**First**, it commodifies basic needs. If cash replaces public services instead of complementing them, survival becomes a private transaction. Health, housing and education are sold back to the poor at inflated prices.

**Second**, it normalises cheap labour. Elites use a minimal income floor to justify suppressing wages and dismantling protections. Without union power or public jobs, precarity deepens.

**Third**, it fuels ecological breakdown. A UBI that increases disposable income without transforming production simply accelerates extraction. The so-called "green transition" is already built on resource plunder in the Global South. If financed through regressive taxes or foreign rents, UBI becomes another tool of imperial management.

**Market-friendly UBI offers individual security inside a system that depends on collective insecurity.**
Capital needs unemployment, debt and cheap resources to function. A UBI that leaves these intact merely oils the machine.

Neoliberal stabilisation works this way: manage unrest with cash transfers, privatise the commons, and protect profit. The beneficiaries are predictable — financial institutions, tech monopolies, extractive firms, and employers seeking wage subsidies. On the other side stand workers, small farmers, indigenous communities and women in unpaid care — those whose labour and land sustain capital’s wealth.

## What an Ecosocial UBI Would Look Like

To be liberatory, UBI must be embedded in **a wider ecosocial programme** that democratises ownership, decarbonises production and restores the commons.

### Democratic Foundations

Control must rest with people, not markets. Resource rents, social services and distribution must be governed through democratic institutions — local councils, unions and cooperatives — not outsourced to private contractors or international lenders.

### Universality and Adequacy

Means-testing breeds stigma and bureaucracy. Universality affirms shared rights. Payments must be adequate to cover essentials; a token grant entrenches precarity.

### Public Provision

Cash must sit alongside universal healthcare, housing, childcare, education and transport. Public systems prevent private rentiers from capturing value. Without them, cash dissolves into inflation and profiteering.

### Financing Justice

Fund UBI through **progressive taxation and reparative finance** — wealth taxes, financial transaction levies, windfall taxes on extractive profits, and pollution taxes. Cancel odious debts that lock the Global South into extraction. Debt cancellation is not charity; it is restitution for centuries of plunder.

### Reclaiming Resource Rents

Extractive profits must flow back into social wages and ecological restoration. In South Africa, taxing mineral rents could fund both UBI and public employment in decarbonisation.

### Work and Dignity

Pair UBI with a jobs guarantee in care, restoration and climate work. That expands labour’s freedom rather than undermining it. Work should be dignified, socially useful and ecologically sane — not coerced survival.

### Ecological Transformation

Ecosocial UBI must shrink consumption’s footprint by reorganising production. Public transport over private cars, shared infrastructure over wasteful individualism. High living standards through collective provision, not endless growth.

### Global Solidarity

Capital flight and tax evasion are transnational. So must be justice. Progressive tax coordination, corporate accountability and reparative transfers are essential. Without this, any UBI in the Global South will bleed into offshore accounts.

These principles already have real precedents. **Brazil’s Bolsa Família** combined cash transfers with healthcare and education. **South Africa’s social grants** demonstrate the feasibility of redistribution even within fiscal constraint. **Kerala’s localised planning** integrates social provision, ecological protection and participatory budgeting. The task is to **weave these fragments into a coherent ecosocial plan.**

---

## Answering the Predictable Objections

**"It will make people lazy."**
Evidence says otherwise. People use cash to meet needs, not to avoid work. What UBI undermines is the compulsion to accept exploitation.

**"It’s unaffordable."**
Affordability is political. States can fund militaries, bail out banks and subsidise fossil capital. Wealth exists; it’s hoarded. Redirect it.

**"It will pacify people."**
That depends on design. A minimal, marketised payment can pacify. But an **adequate, universal, and publicly controlled** income enlarges the political space for organising and resistance. That is why elites fear it.

---

## From Policy to Power

UBI will not be won through technocratic persuasion but **through organised struggle**. Policy follows power.

The coalition capable of winning an ecosocial UBI already exists in fragments:

- workers in both formal and informal economies whose labour is precarious and devalued;
- women performing unpaid care that underpins capital accumulation;
- communities resisting extraction, land dispossession and pollution;
- indigenous movements defending land and life;
- young people facing ecological and economic collapse.

These struggles are not separate. They form a common front against the same system that exploits labour, colonises nature and disciplines life through debt.

Every campaign for a living wage, debt cancellation or public ownership builds the foundations of an ecosocial UBI. Each act of resistance strengthens the capacity to demand redistribution on our terms, not the market’s.

## A Final Demand

UBI can be liberation — if we make it part of a broader fight for democracy, ecology and justice.

Insist on a **universal and adequate** income, funded by taxing wealth and extraction, not the poor. Pair it with public services and a jobs guarantee. Anchor it in democratic control and global solidarity.

This is not charity. It is restitution. A redistribution of what was stolen — from workers, from communities, from the earth itself.

Fight for a UBI that forms the floor of a new social order, not a patch for empire’s decay.
