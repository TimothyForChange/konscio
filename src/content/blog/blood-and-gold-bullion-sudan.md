# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan’s War

Gold is not neutral. It is capital made visible: heavy, portable, and irresistibly fungible. In Sudan, bullion is the fuel of warfare. It buys drones, lubricates smuggling networks, and underwrites a paralysing geopolitics in which foreign markets and mercantile states profit while entire regions are emptied of life.

This is not a story of scarcity or criminality alone. It is a structural story: **extractivism as war finance**, extractivism as statecraft. The same commercial appetites that turned the Congo into a theatre of mineral violence and turned Palestine into a laboratory for militarised dispossession now make Sudan’s goldfields a prize worth killing for.

## The Gold Economy of War

Sudan’s civil war, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has long had a material heartbeat: gold. Since the eruption of large-scale fighting in April **2023**, both parties have turned to mining and trading gold to pay fighters, buy weapons, and keep patronage networks alive. Analysts identify the scramble for gold assets as one of the conflict’s core drivers.

Legal exports, official channels, and a vast shadow economy now channel Sudanese gold to international markets. The United Arab Emirates has been the largest destination for Sudan’s official exports, at times absorbing nearly **90%** of declared shipments, valuing hundreds of millions of dollars. When the UAE instituted a de facto flight and shipping embargo last month, it exposed how dependent Sudan’s wartime economy is on a single foreign gateway.

But official figures only tell part of the story. Investigations and industry studies show that **smuggling networks** — via Egypt, Libya, Chad and other routes — move vast quantities of artisanal and industrial gold outside state controls. These opaque channels allow armed actors, local elites and international middlemen to monetise conflict minerals while leaving destruction and displacement behind.

## Who Benefits, Who Arms, Who Pays

Two mechanisms sustain the bullion-for-war cycle.

First: **buyers and routes**. Gulf commodity hubs, principally in the UAE, offer liquidity and market access. They buy, refine, and re-export gold that frequently lacks transparent provenance. This demand transforms gold into a fungible resource that can be turned into hard currency or used to procure weapons and strategic services. Recent reporting estimates that legal and illicit gold exports have been worth **hundreds of millions** annually — a lifeline for whichever actor controls the mines.

Second: **re-exported weapons and foreign facilitation**. Arms and drone technology flow through complex re-export networks. Amnesty International’s investigation identified advanced weaponry re-exported by the UAE and later used in Sudanese theatres, in clear breach of UN arms embargoes. These are not abstract hyperlinks; they are the physical means by which bullion buys death.

The result is grotesquely simple: **gold funds the violence that secures more gold**. Mining sites are militarised, communities displaced, and labour forced into hazardous artisanal extraction, which in turn raises production that can be smuggled and monetised abroad. The loop is extraction → militarisation → export → weapon procurement → extraction.

## Human and Ecological Cost

The human toll is vast. Years of fighting have produced a humanitarian catastrophe. Estimates in major investigations place conflict deaths in the **hundreds of thousands** and displacement on the order of **millions** — whole communities uprooted, agricultural seasons lost, and urban centres reduced to rubble.

Mining itself inflicts ecological damage. Artisanal operations use weak regulation, invasive chemicals, and deforestation to access deposits. The environmental consequences — poisoned water tables, eroded soils, destroyed grazing lands — will hobble recovery long after the guns fall silent. In a country where agriculture once sustained millions, the conversion of land into mining concessions is a slow, systemic eviction.

This pattern will sound familiar to readers of this series. The DRC’s cobalt belts and the Congo Basin’s forests have experienced precisely these linkages: mineral wealth militarises territory, external demand feeds extraction, and local livelihoods are sacrificed for globally traded value. That continuity is not accidental; it is the logic of extractive capitalism and imperial markets.

## Policy Failures and Complicity

The international system is culpable in two ways.

First, **market opacity**: global gold markets lack consistent due-diligence mechanisms that would make conflict gold harder to sell. The luxury of plausibly deniable trade — re-labelling, re-refining, third-party re-exports — keeps the smuggling pipeline open. Human Rights Watch and other NGOs have urged traders and refiners to adopt robust supply-chain rules; industry inertia and geopolitical hedging have slowed action.

Second, **geopolitical shielding**: actors that profit from access and influence — whether banks, trading houses, or state actors — rarely face sustained penalties. When a rich trader or a Gulf market buys gold that funds atrocities, the moral calculus is obscured by laws, brokered deals, and diplomatic ties. Investigations have documented weapon supplies and re-export chains tied to Gulf actors that should have triggered sanctions and enforcement. Instead, the flows continue until political pressure forces a superficial pause.

## Parallels: Congo, Palestine, and a Single System

There is a pattern that repeats across the Global South.

In the DRC, the demand for cobalt and other critical minerals fuels extraction regimes that despoil land, militarise communities, and externalise value, leaving Congolese people and ecosystems to pay the cost. The same market logics, the same foreign corporate appetites, and the same juridical loopholes appear in Sudan’s gold trade.

Likewise, Palestine reveals how militarised control and foreign complicity enforce dispossession and ecological violence. Weapons tested on occupied populations are normalised and exported; the same markets and diplomatic shields that allow military hardware to circulate also permit minerals and capital to flow where they will. The throughline is imperial power protecting profit at the expense of life. (See recent analysis on Palestine in this series for the argument in full.)

## What Must Change

This is not a technocratic problem to be mercifully fixed by audits; it is political. A credible response requires:

- **Rigorous supply-chain laws**: binding due-diligence for gold, mandatory provenance tracing, and independent audits of refineries and trading houses. Civil society and multilateral authorities must close re-export loopholes.
- **Targeted sanctions and enforcement**: not only on individual smugglers but on complicit corporate hubs and re-export markets that knowingly accept conflict gold. Amnesty’s arms findings show the scale of complicity and the need for legal accountability.
- **Reparative flows**: redirect revenues from natural resources into community restitution, land restoration, and survivor support rather than into patronage networks.
- **Demilitarisation and ecological restoration**: financial and technical support to rehabilitate mining-ravaged ecosystems, paired with community control over resources.

These demands echo the programme for climate and resource justice set out across the Global South: transfer power, not charity; restructure markets, not only morals.

## Closing: Bullion Is Not Benign

Gold is more than a commodity. In Sudan, it is a weapon in longform, a currency of violence that links land, labour, and foreign policy. The bullion that lines palace vaults and trades in glittering souks is inherited violence: the same extractive relations that have bled the Congo and sanctioned occupation elsewhere.

If we are serious about decolonisation and ecological survival, we must treat gold as we treat arms: trace its paths, name its beneficiaries, and stop pretending that markets are above politics. Otherwise, the price will continue to be paid in blood.

— In solidarity with the people of Sudan, the DRC, and Palestine; with miners, farmers, and all who resist extraction.
