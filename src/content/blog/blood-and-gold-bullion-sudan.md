  An eco-socialist investigation of how gold underwrites Sudan's war — and how the RSF's plunder economy, foreign sponsors, and imperial markets profit from blood and bullion.
excerpt: |
  Gold is Sudan's war currency. The RSF's smuggling empire, backed by foreign capital, turns extraction into annihilation, while the state fragments and civilians pay the cost.

# Blood and Bullion: How Gold Fuels Sudan's War

Gold is not neutral. It is capital made visible: heavy, portable, and irresistibly fungible.
In Sudan, bullion is the fuel of warfare. It buys drones, lubricates smuggling networks, and sustains a parasitic war economy in which militias and foreign brokers profit while entire regions are emptied of life.

The reality transcends scarcity and chaos. It is fundamentally a structural story: **extractivism as war finance**, extractivism as empire.
The same commercial appetites that turned the Congo into a theatre of mineral violence and turned Palestine into a laboratory for militarised dispossession now make Sudan's goldfields a prize worth killing for.

## The Gold Economy of War

Sudan's civil war has a material heartbeat: gold.
Since the eruption of large-scale fighting in April **2023**, the **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)**—a militia born from the Janjaweed death squads of Darfur—have built an entire economy on smuggling, forced labour, and cross-border trade.

The **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)**, the formal army, remains fragmented but still tied to the idea of statehood. Its leadership is implicated in corruption, but its rank and file include soldiers defending communities from the RSF's rapacious advance. The SAF's failures are political; the RSF's crimes are existential.

Investigations show that RSF commanders have captured gold mines in Darfur and South Kordofan, forcing miners to work under militia supervision and using profits to import drones and weapons. Entire towns have been razed in their path. Survivors speak of massacres, rape, and forced displacement—violence funded by bullion and lubricated by Gulf money.

Legal exports, official channels, and a vast shadow economy now channel Sudanese gold to international markets. The **United Arab Emirates** has become the main gateway, absorbing up to **90%** of declared shipments. But behind those numbers lies a darker current: **RSF-controlled smuggling networks** moving gold via Chad, Libya, and Egypt, bypassing all state oversight.

These routes convert looted land into currency, sustaining a militia that wages war not for liberation but for control of resource flows.

## The RSF's War of Plunder

The RSF's economic model is textbook neo-colonial extraction.
It does not build or govern; it consumes. Its commanders sell gold through foreign intermediaries, buy weapons through the same channels, and use violence to secure new sources of loot.

Darfur, long the site of genocide, has become the militia's treasury. Satellite imagery and human rights reports confirm scorched villages and mass graves. Women are enslaved in mining zones, and children are conscripted into labour. The militia's atrocities are not incidental—they are the operating logic of its economy.

By contrast, the SAF's power is bureaucratic and brittle. It clings to state legitimacy but lacks social legitimacy. Yet for many civilians, particularly in northern and eastern Sudan, the SAF remains the only structure preventing total collapse into warlord rule. While the SAF is not the solution, the RSF represents the abyss.

## Human and Ecological Cost

The human toll is staggering. Independent estimates place conflict deaths in the **hundreds of thousands**, with **millions displaced.**
Entire cities—El Geneina, Nyala, Omdurman—bear the scars of RSF shelling and scorched-earth tactics. Humanitarian corridors are blocked, aid convoys looted, and civilians targeted for belonging to the wrong ethnic group.

Mining itself is a second front of destruction. The RSF's unregulated artisanal pits use mercury and cyanide, contaminating rivers and soil. Deforestation spreads across Darfur and South Kordofan. What gold cannot kill by bullet, it poisons by runoff.

The SAF's presence in some regions has at least slowed the pace of environmental devastation, yet both sides remain trapped in a model where gold underwrites war and ruins recovery. Sudan bleeds for a metal that leaves nothing behind but ash.

## Foreign Complicity

The international system is not a bystander.
The **UAE's gold markets** and refiners are central to the laundering of RSF gold, even as the Gulf presents itself as a peace broker.
**Russia's Wagner Group**, now rebranded under new corporate shells, has trained RSF units and facilitated logistics in exchange for mining access.

Meanwhile, Western governments issue statements on "stability" while their banks process the very financial flows that keep the trade alive.
Sanctions are selective; outrage is choreographed. It is a theatre of hypocrisy, a world order that condemns human rights abuses while profiting from the minerals that make them possible.

## Parallels: Congo, Palestine, and a Single System

From Darfur to Donbas, from Gaza to Goma, the logic repeats: **resource control through militarised extraction.**
In the DRC, cobalt and coltan finance corporate empires.
In Palestine, land is expropriated under the banner of "security."
In Sudan, gold fuels a militia that serves as both warlord and subcontractor of empire.

Rather than chaos, this represents capitalism's natural form in the periphery.
The same imperial core that buys "conflict-free" gold also sells the weapons that make it bloody.

## What Must Change

This conflict requires structural dismantling rather than pacification by press release.

- **Cut off the RSF's gold economy** through real supply-chain enforcement and targeted sanctions on refineries, shippers, and Gulf financiers.
- **Hold international traders and banks accountable** for laundering RSF gold through Dubai, Istanbul, and European hubs.
- **Support civilian and local governance** over resource zones—community control, not militia control.
- **Cancel Sudan's odious debts** and redirect funds toward ecological restoration and survivor reparations.
- **Restructure global gold markets** so transparency replaces opacity, and justice replaces liquidity.

Without these shifts, every gram of gold will carry the weight of a grave.

## Closing: Gold and Blood

Gold represents the mirror of global greed, not just Sudan's tragedy.
Each ingot refined in Dubai or Zurich carries the memory of poisoned rivers and massacred villages.

If we are serious about decolonisation, we must name the system plainly: **the RSF's plunder is the empire's profit.**
To end one, we must confront both.

— In solidarity with the people of Sudan, the DRC, and Palestine; with miners, farmers, and all who resist extraction.
