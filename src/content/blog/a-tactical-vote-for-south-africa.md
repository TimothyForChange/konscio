# A Tactical Vote for Our Communities: Why South Africans Should Consider Unite for Change

South Africa's towns and cities are breaking.
Water is polluted. Roads collapse. Waste is left to rot.
Local government has become a feeding trough for the connected few.

This election will not bring liberation. It will not deliver our ideal system.
But it can make a difference in who gets to manage our municipalities.
That difference matters.

South Africans should consider voting for **Unite for Change** in the local elections.
Not because they represent our full vision.
Not because they carry all our politics.
But because they might slow the decay and open space for people's power to grow.

## The Local Crisis

Our municipalities are dying from neglect and corruption.
The ANC hollowed out governance through patronage.
The DA turned service delivery into a marketing slogan.
The EFF offers noise, not substance.

Progressive political movements are fragmented, with too few organisers and no strong electoral base.
That is not a betrayal of principles. It is a material reality we must face.

People need water before they can fight for change.
They need functioning councils before they can demand transformation.

A broken municipality kills community organising.
A working one makes it possible.

## The Tactical Vote

Unite for Change is not revolutionary. They are modest reformers.
But reformers can still break the stranglehold of corruption and clientelism.

A few honest councillors can open public budgets, publish tenders, and bring local decisions back into the light.
That is not transformation, but it is leverage.

We do not vote for perfection. We vote to weaken decay.

## What a Vote Is, and Isn't

Voting is not surrender. It is a tactic for change.
We use the ballot to defend our communities, not to sanctify the system.

A tactical vote for Unite for Change is about survival.
It is a defensive move for communities left behind.

After the election, the real work continues:
to organise, to build cooperatives, to demand accountability and public control of services.
The ballot box is not the end of our politics. It is the floor we stand on.

---

## Political Realism

Purity is a luxury in a collapsing world.
We cannot abstain while fascists, neoliberals, and kleptocrats consolidate power.

Democratic politics is grounded in material struggle, not moral theatre.
That means fighting wherever we can — at the ballot, on the streets, in the workplace.

Voting for Unite for Change does not betray our principles.
It protects the conditions that make change possible.

---

## After the Vote

If Unite for Change wins local footholds, we must hold them accountable:

- Demand participatory budgeting.
- Enforce transparency.
- Insist on environmental protection and social justice in every ward.

If they fail, we expose them.
If they deliver, we push them further.
Either way, we build our movements outside the chambers.
